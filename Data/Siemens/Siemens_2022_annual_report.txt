1\. Organization of the Siemens Group and basis of presentation
===

Siemens is a technology group that is active in nearly all countries of the world, focusing on the areas of automation and digitalization in the process and manufacturing industries, intelligent infrastructure for buildings and distributed energy systems, smart mobility solutions for rail transport, and medical technology and digital healthcare services.

Siemens comprises Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens AG), a stock corporation under the Federal laws of Germany, as the parent company, and its subsidiaries. Our Company is incorporated in Germany, with our corporate headquarters situated in Munich. As of September 30, 2022, Siemens had around 311,000 employees.

As of September 30, 2022, Siemens has the following reportable segments: Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure, Mobility and Siemens Healthineers, which together form our "Industrial Business" and Siemens Financial Services (SFS), which supports the activities of our industrial businesses and also conducts its own business with external customers. Furthermore, we report results for Portfolio Companies, which comprises businesses that are managed separately to improve their performance.

Our reportable segments and Portfolio Companies may do business with each other, leading to corresponding orders and revenue. Such orders and revenue are eliminated on the Group level.


## Non-financial matters of the Group and Siemens AG

Siemens has policies for environmental, employee and social matters, for the respect of human rights, and anti-corruption and bribery matters, among others. Our business model is described in chapters 1 and 3 of this Combined Management Report. Reportable information that is necessary for an understanding of the development, performance, position and the impact of our activities on these matters is included in this Combined Management Report, in particular in chapters 3 through 7. Forward-looking information, including risk disclosures, is presented in chapter 8. Chapter 9 includes additional information that is required to be reported in the Combined Management Report related to the parent company Siemens AG. As supplementary information, amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG related to such non-financial matters, and additional explanations thereto, are included in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022, Notes 17, 18, 22, 26 and 27, and in the Notes to the Annual Financial Statements for fiscal 2022, Notes 16, 17, 20, 21 and 25. In order to inform the users of the financial reports in a focused manner, these disclosures are not subject to a specific non-financial framework - in contrast to the disclosures in our separate "Sustainability report 2022" document, which are based on the standards developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Said document also includes detailed information on DEGREE, Siemens' sustainability framework. With DEGREE, Siemens intends to manage and track its progress on selected ambitions in the environmental, social and governance areas.

Disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy: The key performance indicators in this section were determined based on Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 in conjunction with the International Financial Reporting Standards applicable for the Consolidated Financial Statements. Thereby, revenue, capital expenditures and operating expenses were predominantly directly allocated to an economic activity listed in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/852; in determining capital expenditures and operating expenses, allocations were also made based on the revenue of the Taxonomy-eligible activities. To avoid double counting, the allocation was always made to one economic activity only. Taxonomy-eligible revenue accounted for 20% of revenue according to the Consolidated Statement of Income in the reporting year. In the reporting year, Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures accounted for 40% of additions (including additions from business combinations) to other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in accordance with Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxonomy-eligible operating expenses accounted for 14% of the corresponding expenses recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the reporting year. The remaining portions of the key performance indicators are not Taxonomy- eligible. Our main Taxonomy-eligible economic activities are derived from the manufacture of low-carbon transport and energy-efficient building technologies (mainly from Mobility and Smart Infrastructure operations), transport infrastructure (from Mobility operations) and the service of energy-efficient building technologies (from Smart Infrastructure operations), as well as the Group's own real estate portfolio. The majority of Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures result from the latter economic activity. The above-mentioned economic activities refer to chapters 3, 6 and 7 of Annex I of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/852.

## I 2. Financial performance system


### 2.1 Revenue growth

In the Siemens Financial Framework we aim to achieve a revenue growth range of 5% to 7% per year on a comparable basis over a cycle of three to five years. Our primary measure for managing and controlling our revenue growth is comparable growth, because it shows the development in our business net of currency translation effects, which arise from the external environment outside of our control, and portfolio effects, which involve business activities which are either new to or no longer a part of the respective business.

Currency translation effects are the difference between revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the current period and revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the comparison period. For calculating the percentage change year-over-year, this absolute difference is divided by revenue for the comparison period. A portfolio effect arises in the case of an acquisition or a disposition and is calculated as the change year-over-year in revenue related to the transaction. For calculating the percentage change, this absolute change is divided by revenue for the comparison period. Any portfolio effect is excluded for the 12 months following the relevant transaction after which both current and past reporting periods fully reflect the portfolio change. For orders, we apply the same calculations for currency translation and portfolio effects as described above.


### 2.2 Profitability and capital efficiency

Within the Siemens Financial Framework, we aim to achieve over a cycle of three to five years margins that are comparable to those of our relevant competitors. Therefore, we have defined profit margin ranges for our industrial businesses which also consider the profit margins of their respective relevant competitors. Profit margin is defined as profit of the respective business divided by its revenue.

For our industrial businesses, profit represents EBITA adjusted for amortization of intangible assets not acquired in business combinations. We have set the following margin ranges:

| | Margin range |
| - | - |
| Digital Industries | 17 - 23% |
| Smart Infrastructure | 11 - 16% |
| Mobility | 10 - 13% |
| Siemens Healthineers | 17 - 21% |
| | |
| Siemens Financial Services (ROE after tax) | 15 - 20% |

For Siemens Healthineers, we present the margin range we expect as that company's majority shareholder.

In line with common practice in the financial services business, our financial indicator for measuring capital efficiency at SFS is return on equity after tax, or ROE after tax. ROE is defined as SFS' profit after tax, divided by its average allocated equity.

Primary measure for managing and controlling profit and profitability at the Group level: Net income is the primary driver of basic earnings per share from net income (EPS) as well as of EPS before purchase price allocation accounting (EPS pre PPA) which is used for our capital market communication. EPS pre PPA is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and related income taxes. As with EPS, EPS pre PPA includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG. We aim to achieve high-single-digit annual growth in EPS pre PPA over a cycle of three to five years.

We seek to work profitably and as efficiently as possible with the capital provided by our shareholders and lenders. For purposes of managing and controlling our capital efficiency, we use return on capital employed, or ROCE, as our primary measure in our Siemens Financial Framework. Our goal is to achieve a ROCE within a range of 15% to 20% over a cycle of three to five years.


### 2.3 Capital structure

Sustainable revenue and profit development is supported by a healthy capital structure. Accordingly, a key consideration within the Siemens Financial Framework is to maintain ready access to the capital markets through various debt products and preserve our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. Our primary measure for managing and controlling our capital structure is the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations). This financial measure indicates the approximate amount of time in years that would be needed to cover Industrial net debt through income from continuing operations, without taking into account interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We aim to achieve a ratio of up to 1.5.


### 2.4 Liquidity and dividend

We intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. In the Siemens Financial Framework, we strive for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or that at least matches the prior year level.

As in the past, we intend to fund the dividend payout from Free cash flow. Our primary measure to assess our ability to generate cash, and ultimately to pay dividends, is the cash conversion rate for the Siemens Group, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow (continuing and discontinued operations) to Net income. Over a cycle of three to five years, we aim to achieve a cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate.

At the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, will submit the following proposal to allocate the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for fiscal 2022: to distribute a dividend of €4.25 on each share of no par value entitled to the dividend for fiscal 2022 existing at the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting; the remaining amount is to be carried

<!-- PageNumber="4" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

forward. Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval by Siemens shareholders at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 9, 2023. The prior-year dividend was €4.00 per share.

I 3. Segment information

## 3.1 Overall economic conditions

Global economic development in fiscal 2022 was dominated by three disruptions: the war in Ukraine, the repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), and the economic slowdown in China. After the strong rebound of economic growth in calendar 2021, in which global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 5.9%, calendar 2022 is expected to show global GDP increasing by only 2.9%. The post- COVID economic recovery came to a sudden end during calendar 2022.

Global economic activity expanded strongly in the second half of calendar 2021 in light of increasing vaccination rates and lifted COVID- 19 restrictions as well as recovering consumer spending. This triggered inflationary pressures, especially in the United States (U.S.) and in Europe. Primary reasons for these inflationary pressures included limitations on the supply of goods and services due to COVID-19 repercussions (logistics bottlenecks, material and component shortages in the manufacturing sector, labor shortages especially in the service sector), while large stimulus packages and high household savings fueled pent-up demand. In addition, already high energy prices increased significantly and added to surging inflation rates.

The war in Ukraine impacted the overall economic conditions starting in the first quarter of calendar 2022. Energy prices - already soaring in the latter half of 2021 - sky-rocketed in the first half of calendar 2022. The tightening of gas flows from Russia to the European Union (EU) resulted in European natural gas prices temporarily increasing by as much as ten-fold compared to the prior year. Oil prices also increased significantly - global prices for Brent crude oil nearly doubled in March 2022 compared to March 2021. Both over-proportionally hit Germany and the industrial sector, especially energy-intensive industries such as chemicals. But due to its very strong start in calendar 2022, the EU economy is still expected to grow by 3.3% in calendar 2022.

The war in Ukraine put further pressure on developing economies, especially in the Middle East, Africa, and Turkey, as both Russia and Ukraine were major exporters of grain and fertilizer before the war. For emerging markets in aggregate, GDP is estimated to increase by 3.4% in calendar 2022 after it expanded by nearly 7% in 2021.

China's zero-COVID strategy became even more strict with the emergence of the Delta variant and the highly infectious Omicron variant, resulting in more major lockdowns which burdened economic activity and global supply chains in the second half of calendar 2021. In addition, regulatory restrictions on several high-growth sectors and companies along with a recession in the very important real estate sector weighed on the economy. Hence, China's GDP growth is expected to slow significantly in calendar 2022, to 3.0%, after it rebounded in calendar 2021 with 8.1%.

While energy prices were a major contributor to inflationary pressure, both the U.S. and the EU experienced broader-based price increases. This resulted in a strong response by the Federal Reserve which massively tightened monetary policy by starting to reduce money supply (quantitative tightening) and increasing its key interest rate by 300 basis points from March to September 2022. The European Central Bank (ECB) also started to tighten monetary policy to reduce inflation. ECB's interest rate on main refinancing operations increased by a cumulative 125 basis points in August and September. U.S. inflation (as measured by the consumer price index, or CPI) is currently expected at 8.1% for calendar 2022, with EU inflation at 9%. Producer prices (PPI) are expected to increase even more: by 16.8% in the U.S. and as much as 30.4% in the EU, though a large part of the increase in the EU is driven by energy prices: while the overall PPI in September 2022 increased by 41.4% year-over-year, the index excluding energy grew by only 15% year-over-year.

As the Federal Reserve went forward with tackling inflation, it was followed by central banks around the world. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar against most other currencies added to inflation outside of the U.S. and put pressure on international financial markets, especially for some emerging countries.

Overall, the major economies experienced significant economic disruptions during calendar 2022. Therefore, GDP in calendar 2022 will grow much more slowly than was expected last year. For advanced countries in aggregate, calendar 2022 GDP is expected to expand by 2.5%. For emerging markets, the increase in calendar 2022 GDP is estimated at 3.4%.

The partly estimated figures presented here for GDP are based on an S&P Global report dated November 15, 2022.


## 3.2 Digital Industries

Digital Industries offers a comprehensive product portfolio and system solutions for automation used in discrete and process industries; these offerings include automation systems and software for factories, numerical control systems, motors, drives and inverters and integrated automation systems for machine tools and production machines. Digital Industries also provides process control systems, machine-to-machine communication products, sensors (for measuring pressure, temperature, level, flow rate, distance or shape) and radio frequency identification systems. Furthermore, Digital Industries offers production and product lifecycle management (PLM) software, and software for simulation and testing of mechatronic systems. These leading software offerings are integrated with an electronic design automation (EDA) software portfolio, and the open, cloud-based industrial Internet of Things (IoT) operating system MindSphere, which connects machines and physical infrastructure to the digital world. All these software offerings are complemented by the Mendix cloud-native low-code application development platform, which allows customers to significantly reduce app development times through visual representation of underlying code as well as by digital marketplaces for the global electronics value chain, such as Supplyframe and Pixeom. Digital Industries also provides customers with lifecycle and data-driven services.

Taken together, Digital Industries' offerings enable customers to optimize entire value chains from product design and development through production and post-sale services. With its advanced software solutions in particular, Digital Industries supports customers in their evolution towards the "Digital Enterprise," resulting in increased flexibility and efficiency of production processes and reduced time to market for new products. The most important customer customermarkets include the automotive industry, the machine building industry, the pharmaceutical and chemicals industry, the food and beverage industry and the electronics and semiconductor industry. Digital Industries serves its customers through a common regional sales organization spanning all its businesses, using various sales channels depending on the type of customer and industry and also enhancing customer choice across all channels. Changes in customer demand, especially for standard products, are driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles, and can lead to significant short-term fluctuation in Digital Industries' profitability. Volume from large contracts in the software business, particularly for EDA, may also result in strong fluctuations

<!-- PageNumber="0 6" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

in quarterly volume and profitability. In fiscal 2022, Digital Industries started to transition parts of its software business, particularly PLM, from largely upfront revenue recognition towards Software as a Service (Saas), which yields more predictable recurring revenue and offers growth opportunities by opening access to new customers, especially small and medium-sized companies seeking to reduce costs associated with owning complex IT infrastructure. The transition held back revenue growth rates and profit margin development in the software business in fiscal 2022 and Digital Industries expects continued impacts until completion of the transition. Competition with Digital Industries' business activities comes primarily from multinational corporations that offer a relatively broad portfolio and from smaller companies active only in certain geographic or product markets.

Digital Industries sees three trends influencing its business and providing long-term growth opportunities. Producers of investment goods in today's increasingly digital environment must modernize their production capacity, particularly to increase production flexibility and reduce time to market. This environment also spurs producers to complement their core products with vertical solutions and service offerings, which their customers either need or want in order to take full advantage of the investment goods. Finally, there is a trend from globalization to regionalization, to support local economic development, to increase supply chain resilience or to better adapt solutions to local needs. This is increasingly accompanied by more differentiated regulatory requirements.

Research & Development (R&D) activities at Digital Industries are aimed at helping customers to increase production and resource efficiency by merging the real and the digital worlds in a continuous flow of data using cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (Al), edge computing, cloud technologies, additive manufacturing, and industrial 5G technology. As part of Siemens' open digital marketplace Siemens Xcelerator - a business platform that includes a curated portfolio of IoT-enabled hardware, software and digital services from across Siemens and certified third parties and facilitates interactions and transactions between customers, partners and developers - Digital Industries is developing Industrial Operations X, a next-generation industrial loT solution. Industrial Operations X is aimed at bringing together solutions and applications, ranging from sensors and edge computing to the cloud, IoT as a service and low- code development capabilities, as well as including a wide range of ready-to-use apps. Furthermore, in fiscal 2022, Digital Industries launched the open Industrial Edge Ecosystem where third-party app providers can offer solutions based on the Siemens Industrial Edge platform, an IT platform which enables the scalable deployment of IT technologies and apps in the production environment. Customers thus benefit from a broad range of compatible software components, offered by numerous providers and manufacturers, which they can readily integrate into their manufacturing processes. For example, offerings of the Industrial Edge Ecosystem include an AI-based edge app to increase availability of drives. In fiscal 2022, Digital Industries strengthened its transition to SaaS by introducing a cloud-based version of its NX software (NX X) that combines the advantages of computer aided design software, centralized storage capacity and native collaboration. With its latest advances in additive manufacturing, Digital Industries enables cost-effective bespoke manufacturing of consumer products. Also in fiscal 2022, Digital Industries enabled the transmission of Profinet IO via a private 5G network, which allows industrial data to be transmitted securely across network boundaries in real time for industrial applications. This is made possible by the VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) transmission technology in the Scalance 5G routers and security appliances from Digital Industries. Major investments of Digital Industries in fiscal 2022 relate to its own factory automation, motion control and process automation businesses, to further automate and digitalize facilities particularly in Germany, China and the Czech Republic.

| (in millions of €) | Fiscal year || % Change ||
|| 2022 | 2021 | Actual | Comp. |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Orders | 25,283 | 18,427 | 37% | 32% |
| Revenue | 19,517 | 16,514 | 18% | 13% |
| therein: software business | 4,691 | 4,290 | 9% | 0% |
| Profit | 3,892 | 3,360 | 16% | |
| Profit margin | 19.9% | 20.3% | | |

Order growth was driven by extraordinarily strong customer demand in Digital Industries' major market segments. Orders rose in all businesses including a sharp increase in the factory automation business and substantial growth contributions from the other businesses. Within the software business, both EDA and PLM made strong growth contributions due to large contract wins. Revenue growth was mainly driven by the automation businesses. While Digital Industries successfully avoided major supply chain disruptions, shortages for electronics components and raw materials led to extended delivery times for some automation products. Growth in the software business was due mainly to positive currency translation effects. A high rate of customer acceptance of the PLM SaaS transition reduced current license revenue in favor of recurring future subscription revenue. On a geographic basis, orders rose substantially in all three reporting regions and revenue was up by double digits in all regions. Volume growth was led by the Asia, Australia region and included positive currency translation effects. Profit and profitability rose in all automation businesses led by a sharp increase in the motion control business. The increases were supported by higher capacity utilization and pricing measures to offset cost inflation. In contrast, profit in the software business declined. This was due mainly to revenue development from the SaaS transition and higher expenses related to cloud-based activities, which were also influenced by the SaaS transition. Severance charges fell to €64 million from €114 million in the prior year. Digital Industries' order backlog rose sharply year-over-year, reaching €14 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which €11 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2023.

In fiscal 2022, markets served by Digital Industries grew clearly. Growth was driven by a further recovery in global manufacturing production, only partly held back by impacts related to the war in Ukraine, lockdown measures and electricity shutdowns in China, and global supply chain and logistics constraints. Nominal market growth in fiscal 2022 benefited from fast-rising price inflation especially in discrete and process industries, which started to weigh on real demand, especially consumer spending, towards the end of the fiscal year. Markets grew in all three reporting regions, led by Asia, Australia and the Americas. Overall, markets for discrete industries rose faster while recovery in the more project-related process industries was delayed. Within Digital Industries' most important customer markets, growth in the automotive industry was held back by the above-mentioned factors, most notably supply chain constraints, which impacted production. Ongoing structural changes in the macroeconomy - such as working from home, adoption of e-vehicles, and international trade conflicts - are expected to restrain the automotive industry's mid-term growth perspectives. The machine-building industry expanded strongly, with growth driven by demand in Japan, the U.S. and eastern European countries. The machine-building industry benefited from demand for general investment goods. This development was evident in demand for automation equipment which in addition benefited from the trend towards digitalization. The pharmaceutical and the chemicals industries grew throughout the fiscal year,

<!-- PageNumber="7" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

but with slower momentum towards the end of the fiscal year. The food and beverage industry grew steadily throughout the fiscal year, with the beverage industry growing faster than the food industry. Global production of electronics and semiconductors experienced strong growth in fiscal 2022, with some moderation during the course of the fiscal year due in part to production lockdowns in China. Market shifts before fiscal 2022 in the semiconductor industry led to global shortages of semiconductors for certain customer segments such as the automotive industry; demand patterns began to normalize at the end of the fiscal year, including more moderate spending on consumer electronics. Supplier price increases, caused mainly by shortages, affected all of the key markets for Digital Industries, and were sharper than usual for a period of economic rebound. For fiscal 2023, Digital Industries' primary markets are expected to show strong revenue growth benefiting in part from high order backlogs and price inflation. While growth is expected to be more evenly spread across the three reporting regions than in fiscal 2022, growth momentum is expected to slow down gradually over the course of the fiscal year. Growth expectations for fiscal 2023 are subject to a high level of uncertainty depending among other factors on the development of geopolitical tensions, trade sanctions, energy markets and interest rates.


### 3.3 Smart Infrastructure

Smart Infrastructure offers products, systems, solutions, services and software to support a sustainable transition from fossil to renewable energy sources, as well as a transition to smarter, more sustainable buildings and communities. Smart Infrastructure's versatile portfolio consists of buildings, electrification, and electrical products. Its buildings portfolio addresses the needs of operators, owners, occupants and users of buildings. It spans integrated building management systems and software; heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) controls; fire safety and security products and systems; and solutions and services such as energy performance services. With its electrification portfolio, Smart Infrastructure makes grids more resilient, flexible and efficient. Its offerings cover grid simulation, operation and control software; substation automation and protection; medium-voltage primary and secondary switchgear including sulfur hexafluoride-free (SF6-free) medium-voltage switchgear; and low-voltage switchboards and eMobility charging infrastructure. The electrical products portfolio addresses industrial and building applications. Its offerings include low-voltage switching, measuring and control equipment; low-voltage distribution systems and switchgear; and circuit breakers, contactors and switching for medium voltage. In fiscal 2022, Smart Infrastructure acquired Brightly Software Inc. (Brightly), a U.S .- based provider of cloud-based SaaS for asset and maintenance management and for energy and sustainability management. The acquisition strengthens Smart Infrastructure's presence in the market for software used to manage built infrastructure.

Smart Infrastructure's customer and end user base is diverse. It encompasses infrastructure developers, construction companies and contractors; owners, operators and tenants of both public and commercial buildings including hospitals, campuses, airports and data centers; companies in process industries such as oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and chemicals; companies in discrete manufacturing industries such as automotive and machine building; and utilities and power grid network operators (transmission and distribution). Smart Infrastructure serves its customers through a broad range of channels, including distributors and partners such as panel builders, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and value-added resellers and installers, all complemented by direct sales and through e-commerce channels. Digital marketplaces, such as Siemens Xcelerator, are increasingly important for Smart Infrastructure's digital offerings. Smart Infrastructure's principal competitors consist mainly of large multinational companies and smaller manufacturers in emerging countries. Its solutions and services business also competes with local players such as system integrators and facility management firms. Smart Infrastructure's businesses are impacted by changes in the overall economic environment to varying degrees, depending on the customer segment and offering. Demand for Smart Infrastructure's electrical and building products offerings is driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles, while demand for its systems and solutions offerings changes more slowly, with a time lag of several quarters. In contrast, demand for service offerings shows only limited influence from macroeconomic cycles. Overall, Smart Infrastructure has developed a balanced and resilient business mix with its diversified regional and vertical markets; its range of products, systems, solutions and services; and its participation in both long- and short-cycle markets. To further strengthen the resilience of its portfolio, Smart Infrastructure aims at increasing the share of overall revenue that comes from services.

Smart Infrastructure benefits from a number of major trends. These include urbanization, demographic change, decarbonization, and digitalization. Urbanization and demographic change drive a need for smarter and more human-centric buildings. Climate change drives the need for decarbonization. This results in an increasing demand for flexible and resilient energy infrastructures including rapid growth in electric mobility and more sustainable buildings. Digitalization is an enabler for such changes in both buildings and grids, making it possible to develop smarter buildings and manage electricity distribution with a higher share of renewables. The markets served are experiencing shifts that present opportunities where building technologies and electrification meet.

Smart Infrastructure's R&D activities focus on sustainable and decarbonizing offerings for buildings, utilities and industrial customers. It develops digital offerings for the energy market such as for integrating renewable energy into grids. Furthermore, R&D efforts strengthen Smart Infrastructure's capabilities to improve the sustainability, performance and attractiveness of buildings. Smart Infrastructure is expanding its digital offerings such as cloud solutions using field data from controllers and IoT devices. In June 2022, Smart Infrastructure launched the new software platform Building X, developed in accordance with the principles of openness and modularity of Siemens Xcelerator. Furthermore, it develops technologies for environmentally friendly and increasingly renewable-based energy systems, ranging from climate-friendly SF6-free switchgear for medium voltage to charging solutions for e-mobility. In this regard, data from field devices is the basis for intelligent grid control and protection, providing grid stability and flexibility and continuously matching energy supply and demand while protecting grid assets. For electrical distribution systems and industrial plants, Smart Infrastructure continuously drives digitalization of its switching and control products with built-in intelligence, connectivity to the cloud, and remote diagnostics and edge computing capability. Smart Infrastructure puts an increasing focus of R&D on the sustainability of its products along the lifecycle, addressing environmentally friendly designs, materials and processes.

Orders at Smart Infrastructure rose by double-digits in all businesses, led by the electrical products business and the electrification business including a number of larger contract wins. Order growth was highlighted by strong demand from industrial customers, for data centers and for digital building services, and included proactive purchasing by customers. Revenue also rose in all businesses led by the electrical products business, which operated in strong customer markets. Smart Infrastructure successfully avoided major disruptions from challenging supply chain conditions. On a geographic basis, orders and revenue rose in all three reporting regions. The strongest growth contribution came from the Americas region, driven by the U.S., while growth in the Asia, Australia region was held back by impacts related to COVID-19 in China. Both order and revenue development included positive currency translation effects. Profit and profitability rose in all businesses, with the strongest increases coming from the electrical products business and the buildings business. The increases were due mainly to higher capacity utilization, pricing measures to offset cost inflation and cost savings related to prior execution of Smart Infrastructure's competitiveness program. Severance charges, largely associated with the program, fell to €28 million from €47 million a year earlier. In fiscal 2022, Smart Infrastructure recorded a €54 million gain from the sale of a business. These positive effects were only partly offset by COVID-19-related impacts mainly from medical leaves and lockdowns in China. Smart Infrastructure's order backlog was €15 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which €10 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2023.

Overall, markets served by Smart Infrastructure grew clearly in fiscal 2022. Market dynamics were influenced by a further recovery from COVID-19-related effects, severe supply chain and logistics constraints, strong price inflation and effects from the war in Ukraine. On a geographic basis, all reporting regions contributed to growth. Price inflation affected all regions and came in particularly high in the U.S. In China, growth was held back by lockdown measures, which also impacted growth dynamics in other countries, while Europe was most strongly affected by the war in Ukraine. Grid markets grew above average with market growth driven by demand for integration of energy from renewable resources. Industrial markets grew nearly as fast as grid markets, driven by growth in the automotive industry among other factors. Growth in the buildings market came in somewhat lower mainly due to weaker growth momentum in commercial building markets. In fiscal 2023, markets served by Smart Infrastructure are expected to grow slightly slower than in fiscal 2022. While growth in residential and commercial building markets and some industrial markets is expected to slow down somewhat, demand for data centers and power distribution is expected to be robust. Price inflation is expected to contribute to market growth in fiscal 2023. Overall, market development in fiscal 2023 is expected to continue to be influenced by supply chain constraints and effects from the war in Ukraine, including on energy prices. Further impacts could arise from potential lockdown measures in China and geopolitical tensions.


### 3.4 Mobility

Mobility combines all Siemens businesses in the area of passenger and freight transportation. Within its rolling stock business, its offerings encompass trains for urban and regional transport such as vehicles for metro systems, trams and light rail, and commuter trains as well as trains and passenger coaches for intercity and long-distance services, such as high-speed rail. Rolling stock offerings furthermore include locomotives for freight or passenger transport and solutions for automated transportation such as automated people movers. Offerings in its rail infrastructure business include products and solutions for rail automation, such as automatic train control systems, interlocking, operations control and telematic systems, digital station solutions and railway communication systems, signaling on-board and crossing products and yard and depot solutions; and for electrification such as AC and DC traction power supply, contact lines and network control. With its service business, Mobility provides customer services for rolling stock and rail infrastructure throughout the entire lifecycle, such as maintenance and digital services. In its turnkey business, it bundles consulting, planning, financing, construction, service and operation of complete mobility systems. Mobility's software business comprises intermodal solutions, such as platforms for fleet management, route planning, ticketing and payments solutions and data analytics. To enhance these offerings, Mobility at the beginning of fiscal 2022 acquired SQCAP B.V. (Sqills), Netherlands, a provider of cloud-based inventory management, reservation, and ticketing software for public transport operators. During fiscal 2022, Mobility divested its road traffic business, Yunex Traffic.

Mobility sells its products, systems and solutions through its worldwide network of sales and execution units. The principal customers of Mobility are public and state-owned companies in the transportation and logistics sectors, so its markets are driven primarily by public spending. Customers usually have multi-year planning and implementation horizons, and their contract tenders therefore tend to be independent of short-term economic trends. Large contracts in the rolling stock and the rail infrastructure business are often awarded together with service contracts, which start to generate revenue only after the respective products and solutions have been put in operation, which can be a number of years after the contract award. Mobility's principal competitors are multinational companies. Consolidation among Mobility's competitors is continuing and may lead to increased competitive pressure within the rail transport industry and also to fewer sourcing options for rail customers.

The main trends driving Mobility's markets are urbanization, the need to reduce emissions from transportation, and digitalization. Increasing populations in urban centers need daily mobility that is simpler, faster, and more flexible, reliable and affordable. At the same time, cities and national economies face the challenge of cutting CO2 and noise emissions and reducing space requirements and costs of transportation. The pressure on mobility providers to meet all these needs is expected to rise continuously. Furthermore, improving availability, connectivity, and sustainability of rail infrastructures increasingly requires digital solutions, which generates growth opportunities for providers of such solutions. IoT systems and new software-based solutions such as Mobility as a Service (MaaS) are expected to become major growth enablers for the rail industry. While a significant drop in ridership driven by COVID-19 has strongly impacted mobility operators, overall trends towards urbanization and decarbonization persist unchanged and many countries have been allocating significant funds to rail and public transport operators to address these trends.

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

Mobility's R&D strategy is focused on reducing life-cycle costs of rail infrastructures and rolling stock, securing system availability, increasing network capacity of rail infrastructures, optimizing the processes of rail operators and improving passenger experience. With Siemens Xcelerator, Mobility intends to make software more modular and increasingly move it to the cloud. At the same time, Mobility intends to enhance connectivity of hardware and software and provide open application programming interfaces (APIs). Thereby Mobility accelerates the pace and impact of digital innovation, which in turn benefits owners, operators, and customers of rail transport. Mobility's major R&D areas include the development of efficient vehicle platforms with optimized lifecycle cost; eco-friendly, alternative power supplies for trains; the Railigent X open application suite for maintenance of rail assets; the Distributed Smart Safe System (DS3), which allows for hardware-independent and cloud-enabled signaling; automatic train operation for European Train Control System (ETCS); 5G for wireless-based activities; the Mobility Software Suite X for operators and passengers; and cyber security. Mobility's investments focus mainly on maintaining or enhancing its production facilities, on meeting project demands and enhancing its depot services.

| Profit | 794 | 850 | (7)% | |
| Profit margin | 8.2% | 9.2% | | |

Order intake exceeded the strong prior-year level and reached a new record. Mobility again took in a substantial volume from large orders, nearly on the high level of the prior year. Contract wins in fiscal 2022 were highlighted by an order worth €1.5 billion for high-speed trains in Germany, a number of orders for locomotives, among them a €0.6 billion order for locomotives and associated service in the U.S., and an order worth €0.3 billion for a train control system from Norway. Order intake a year earlier included among others Mobility's largest- ever contract in the Americas, worth €2.8 billion, for trainsets and associated services. Revenue rose in all businesses, led by the services business and the rail infrastructure business. Growth was partly held back by supplier delays in delivering materials and components, along with effects related to COVID-19 mainly including medical leave for employees. On a geographic basis, revenue growth was driven mainly by the region Europe, Commonwealth of Independent States (C.I.S.), Africa, Middle East, due particularly to a significant growth contribution from Germany. Profit was burdened by impairments and other charges totaling €0.6 billion for winding down business activities in Russia, among them a €0.2 billion impairment of the entire carrying amount of an investment accounted for using the equity method. In addition, profit included impacts from supplier delays and COVID-19 effects. These burdens were largely offset by a gain of €0.7 billion from the sale of Yunex Traffic. Severance charges were €27 million, compared to €22 million a year earlier. Mobility's order backlog was €36 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which €10 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2023.

Markets served by Mobility grew moderately in fiscal 2022, supported by long-term trends such as urbanization and decarbonization, though growth dynamics were held back by effects related to COVID-19 and by material shortages. The market for rolling stock saw large orders across all segments, especially for high-speed trains, commuter trains and locomotives. The rail infrastructure market has seen growth in both urban and mainline segments due to the renewal and extension of mainline tracks and the ongoing trend towards automatic train protection (ATP), including communications-based train control (CBTC) and ETCS technologies. The service business benefited from an increased installed base at global level and large backlogs in maintenance orders backlogs in some countries. On a geographic basis, market development in Europe continued to be characterized by awards of mid-size to large orders, particularly in Germany, Denmark and in Switzerland. While demand in the Middle East rose, demand in Africa was held back by ongoing uncertainties related to budget constraints and political climates. In the Americas region, customer demand was strongest for urban and mainline transport, especially in the U.S. and Canada. Within the Asia, Australia region, markets saw ongoing rail investments, particularly in China. For fiscal 2023, markets served by Mobility are expected to grow significantly with all reporting regions contributing to growth. Market expansion is expected to be supported by a large number of fiscal stimulus and investment programs. Mobility anticipates that rail operators in Europe, particularly in Germany and in the U.K., will continue making significant investments in rolling stock and advanced rail infrastructure solutions and that customers in the Middle East and Africa will tender large turnkey systems, especially for additional rail lines in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Markets in the Americas region are expected to remain strong, especially due to ongoing investments in urban and mainline transport and large investment programs dedicated to transportation and enhancements of existing infrastructure in the U.S. In Asia, markets in China are also expected to remain strong with investments in high-speed trains, urban transport, freight logistics and rail infrastructure driving growth. Markets in India are expected to grow strongly due to investments in high-speed trains and infrastructure. Despite an adverse short-term impact from COVID-19, rail transport and intermodal mobility solutions are expected to remain a high priority. In emerging countries, rising incomes are expected to result in greater demand for public transport solutions.


### 3.5 Siemens Healthineers

Siemens as majority shareholder holds just over 75% of the shares of the publicly listed Siemens Healthineers AG, Germany (Siemens Healthineers). Siemens Healthineers is a global provider of healthcare solutions and services. It develops, manufactures, and sells a diverse range of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic products and services to healthcare providers. In addition, Siemens Healthineers also provides clinical consulting services, as well as an extensive range of training and service offerings. This comprehensive portfolio supports customers along the entire care continuum, from prevention and early detection through to diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care. The customer spectrum ranges from public and private healthcare providers, including hospitals and hospital systems, public and private clinics and laboratories, universities, physicians/joint medical practices, public health agencies, public and private health insurers, through to pharmaceutical companies and clinical research institutes. The imaging business provides imaging products, services, and solutions as well as digital offerings. Its most important products are devices for magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, X-ray, molecular imaging, and ultrasound. The diagnostics business comprises in-vitro diagnostic products and services that are offered to healthcare providers in the fields of laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics. The Varian business provides innovative, multi-modality cancer care technologies along with solutions and services to oncology departments in hospitals and clinics. The portfolio of the advanced therapies business consists of highly integrated products, solutions, and services across multiple clinical fields that are designed to support image-

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

guided minimally invasive treatments, in areas such as cardiology, interventional radiology, and surgery. Competition in the imaging, Varian and advanced therapies businesses consists mainly of a small number of large multinational companies, while the diagnostics market is fragmented with a variety of global players that compete with each other across market segments and also with several regional players and specialized companies in niche technologies. The business activities of Siemens Healthineers are to a certain extent resilient to short-term economic trends because large portions of its revenue stem from recurring business. They are, however, directly and indirectly dependent on trends in healthcare markets and on developments in health policy, and geopolitical developments around the world.

The addressable markets of Siemens Healthineers are shaped by four major trends. The first is demographic, in particular the growing and aging global population. This trend poses major challenges for global healthcare systems and, at the same time, offers opportunities for players in the healthcare industry as the demand for cost-efficient healthcare solutions continues to intensify. The second trend is economic development in emerging countries, which opens up improved access to healthcare for many people. Significant investment in the expansion of private and public healthcare systems will persist, driving overall demand for healthcare products and services and hence market growth. The third trend is the increase in chronic diseases as a consequence of an aging population and environmental and lifestyle- related changes. This trend results in far more patients with multiple morbidities, putting further pressure on healthcare systems and leading to higher costs; it also increases the need for new ways to detect and treat diseases more timely. The fourth global trend, the transformation of healthcare providers such as hospitals and laboratories, results from a combination of societal and market forces that are driving healthcare providers to operate and organize their businesses differently. Increasing cost pressure on the healthcare sector is prompting the introduction of new remuneration models for healthcare services, such as value-based rather than treatment-based reimbursement. Digitalization and artificial intelligence are thereby likely to be key enablers for healthcare providers as they increasingly focus on enhancing the overall patient experience, with better outcomes and overall reduction in cost of care. This development is driven partly by society's increasing resistance to healthcare costs, payers' increasing professionalization, burdens from chronic disease, rapid scientific progress and staff shortages. As a result of these factors, healthcare providers are consolidating into networked structures, resulting in larger clinic and laboratory chains, often operating internationally, which act increasingly like large corporations. Applying this industrial logic to the healthcare market can lead to systematic improvements in quality, while at the same time reducing costs.

R&D activities at Siemens Healthineers are aimed at delivering innovative, sustainable solutions to its customers while safeguarding and improving its competitiveness. In particular, in the areas of artificial intelligence, sensing technology, and robotics R&D activities were expanded. In addition, Siemens Healthineers harnesses advanced technologies such as AI and data analytics to improve cancer treatment and expand global access to cancer care. Key applications of sensing technology range from laboratory diagnostic tests via computed tomography detectors and electromagnetic measurement fields in magnetic resonance all the way to ultrasonic transducers. Siemens Healthineers already uses robots for laboratory assistance, radiation, patient handling, and robotic imaging devices. Siemens Healthineers focuses its investments mainly on enhancing competitiveness and innovation. The main capital expenditures were for spending for factories to expand manufacturing and technical capabilities, in particular in the U.S. and China, and for additions to intangible assets, including capitalized development expenses within the Atellica Solution and Central Lab product lines.

| (in millions of €) | Fiscal year || % Change ||

| - | - | - | - | - |
| Orders | 25,556 | 20,320 | 26% | 9% |

| Profit | 3,369 | 2,847 | 18% | |
| Profit margin | 15.5% | 15.8% | | |

In fiscal 2022, Siemens Healthineers recorded double-digit growth both in orders and revenue, which developed similarly. All businesses contributed to this growth. On a geographic basis, the Americas and Asia, Australia regions recorded substantial growth, both benefiting from strong positive portfolio and currency translation effects. In total, portfolio effects, primarily related to the acquisition of Varian in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, added ten percentage points to order and nine percentage points to revenue growth; additionally, currency translation effects added seven percentage points to order and six percentage points to revenue growth. Profit benefited primarily from strong earnings development in the diagnostics business which was driven by high demand for rapid coronavirus antigen tests. The imaging business again posted strong earnings, which were higher than in the prior year. Overall profitability was burdened by subsequent measurement effects from purchase price allocation related to the Varian acquisition totaling €0.2 billion and by higher procurement and logistics costs. Severance charges were €71 million in fiscal 2022 and €68 million in fiscal 2021. The order backlog for Siemens Healthineers was €34 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which €12 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2023.

In general, the addressable global markets excluding rapid coronavirus antigen tests grew slightly on a revenue basis in fiscal 2022. From a regional perspective, the Asia, Australia region saw market growth in most businesses; in China, growth opportunities were prevented by COVID-19-related restrictions. In the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East, EU government investment programs, among others, were able to support growth in most businesses. In the U.S., market growth was recorded in most businesses. Globally, overall market development for the imaging business was supported by positive developments in the magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear medicine markets, after demand had already recovered in the prior fiscal year; in contrast, delays in revenue recognition due to global supply chain constraints, among other factors, weakened growth. The imaging market is expected to grow moderately overall in fiscal 2023, driven mainly by pent-up demand for major modalities. Within the diagnostics business, the rapid coronavirus antigen test market experienced a sharp increase; in addition, point-of-care (excluding rapid coronavirus antigen tests) and laboratory diagnostics (excluding molecular diagnostics) recorded ongoing recovery in patient volumes as markets continued to return to normalized levels following COVID-19 lockdowns. The diagnostics market is expected to achieve moderate growth in fiscal 2023, excluding COVID-19 testing and molecular diagnostics, and return to pre-COVID-19 market growth across most regions. In Varian markets, product and service innovations led to higher customer investment in the U.S. and Western Europe, while other markets were driven by a need to expand access to oncology equipment and services to underserved population groups and regions. The market for Varian is expected to continue its significant growth. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and global supply chain challenges, the resumption of oncology investments is expected to increase. For advanced therapies, the market recovered from COVID-19 in all relevant regions. The expectation for advanced therapies is that the market will continue to grow clearly in fiscal 2023, but at a more measured pace than in fiscal 2022.

Earnings before taxes were affected by an increase of expenses for credit risk provisions compared to fiscal 2021 and for impairments on assets in the debt business. Therein impacts of €0.2 billion were recorded in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business in Russia at the end of fiscal 2022. Decreased results from the debt business were nearly offset by a sharply improved earnings contribution from the equity business, which was driven by gains from fair value measurements and sales of investments, including an offshore wind-farm project divested for a gain of €0.1 billion, and from energy-related investments in connection with rising prices in global energy markets.

The increase in total assets since the end of fiscal 2021 was driven by positive currency translation effects.

Net cash from operations (defined as the sum of cash flows from operating and investing activities) amounted to €(616) million compared to €105 million in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, net cash from operations comprised Free cash flow of €985 million and €820 million, respectively, and remaining cash flows from investing activities, including from change in receivables from financing activities, of €(1,601) million and €(715) million, respectively.

SFS is de-risking its business profile by reducing exposure to energy-related equity investments. This has the additional benefit of more tightly focusing SFS's business scope and capital allocation on areas of intense domain know-how closely aligned with Siemens' customers and markets, particularly for Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Mobility. Accordingly, SFS is influenced by the business development of the markets served by our industrial businesses, among other factors, including macroeconomic effects like inflation or recession which could impact the credit risk of customers. In addition to its high level of diversification across industries, SFS has a strong regional footprint in investment-grade countries, with the highest share in the U.S. SFS intends to maintain a highly diversified portfolio across regions, while participating in the strong economic development of selected Asian markets.


## 3.7 Portfolio Companies

Portfolio Companies comprise businesses which deliver a broad range of customized and application-specific products, software, solutions, systems and services for different industries including oil and gas, chemical, mining, cement, logistics, energy, marine, water and fiber. Unrealized potential within these businesses requires adjustment in their approach using defined measures including internal re-organization, digitalization, cost improvements, and optimizing procurement, production and service activities. After achieving certain threshold performance targets, businesses may be transferred to one of Siemens industrial businesses, combined with an external business from the same industry, sold or placed into an external private equity partnership.

During fiscal 2022, Siemens sold its mail and parcel-handling business (formerly part of Siemens Logistics) to the Körber Group and its at- equity investment in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH to Valeo GmbH. Siemens also reached an agreement in May 2022 to sell its Commercial Vehicles business to Meritor, Inc. Closing of the transaction was at the beginning of fiscal 2023.

Taking these divestments into consideration, Portfolio Companies consists mainly of three fully consolidated, separately managed units. Large Drives Applications, which offers electric motors, converters and solutions for mining, is being carved out to increase its entrepreneurial freedom and thereby unlock its full potential. Siemens Logistics, offers sorting technology and solutions, focused on baggage and cargo handling at airports. The third fully consolidated unit, Siemens Energy Assets, comprises certain remaining regional business activities of the former Gas and Power segment; as part of the Siemens Energy carve-out these activities remained with Siemens due to country-specific regulatory restrictions or economic considerations.

Demand within the industries served by Portfolio Companies mainly shows a delayed response to changes in the overall economic environment. The results are strongly dependent, however, on customer investment cycles in their key industries. In commodity-based industries such as oil and gas or mining, these cycles are driven mainly by commodity price fluctuations rather than changes in produced volumes. The heterogonous industrial customer base of the fully consolidated units requires a dedicated sales approach based on in-depth understanding of specific industries and customer requests, resulting in the use of various sales and marketing channels for Portfolio Companies.

| Profit | 1,520 | (84) | n/a | |
| Profit margin | 47.0% | (2.8)% | | |

Despite supply chain constraints, volume increased primarily due to Large Drives Applications, Siemens Energy Assets and the airport business of Siemens Logistics. The profit was driven by the two disposals mentioned above: a gain of €1.1 billion from the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business and a revaluation gain of €0.3 billion in connection with the sale of the equity investment in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH. For comparison, the loss in fiscal 2021 was due mainly to negative results in the equity investment. Additionally, Portfolio Companies recorded lower severance charges of €20 million, down from €74 million in fiscal 2021. Portfolio Companies' order backlog was €4 billion at the end of fiscal 2022, of which €3 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2023.

Although the broad range of businesses is operating in diverse markets, overall the main markets served by Portfolio Companies are generally impacted by uncertainties regarding geopolitical and economic developments which tend to increase customer caution regarding purchasing decisions. However, ongoing recovery is expected to continue in most end-customer vertical markets in fiscal 2023.


## 3.8 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements

Profit

| (in millions of €) | Fiscal year ||
|| 2022 | 2021 |
| - | - | - |
| Siemens Energy Investment | (2,911) | (396) |
| Siemens Real Estate | 118 | 94 |
| Innovation | (190) | (207) |
| Governance | (582) | (751) |
| Centrally carried pension expense | (113) | (170) |
| Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations | (990) | (738) |
| Financing, eliminations and other items | (474) | 452 |
| Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements | (5,141) | (1,717) |

The result for Siemens Energy Investment was strongly influenced by an impairment of €2.7 billion on Siemens' 35% stake in Siemens Energy AG. The negative result also included Siemens' share of Siemens Energy's after-tax loss and, in addition, expenses from amortization of assets resulting from purchase price allocation due to the initial recognition of the investment at fair value in September 2020.

The increase in Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations related mainly to the acquisition of Varian by Siemens Healthineers.

Financing, eliminations and other items included impacts totaling €0.5 billion at Corporate Treasury, resulting from the sale of Siemens' financing and leasing business in Russia at the end of fiscal 2022. Further negative effects included a revaluation loss of €0.3 billion on the stake in Thoughtworks Holding, Inc. (the prior year included a gain of €0.3 billion on this stake) as well as a loss of €0.1 billion resulting from applying hyperinflation accounting related mainly to Türkiye. These effects were partly offset by a gain of €0.5 billion in connection with an investment accounted for using the equity method mainly due to its fair value measurement. For comparison, fiscal 2021 included gains of €0.4 billion related to the transfers of assets to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. in Germany and expenses of €0.1 billion from revised estimates related to provisions for a legacy project.

Despite a continuing complex macroeconomic environment influenced by energy shortages and availability concerns stemming from the war in Ukraine, high inflation and effects associated with COVID-19, orders related to external customers rose in all four industrial businesses year-over-year with Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Siemens Healthineers recording substantial order growth. The broad-based increase in emerging markets was driven by China and, to a lesser degree, India.

In the Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East region, order intake increased in all four industrial businesses. Order growth was led by substantial increases in Digital Industries and Mobility. Smart Infrastructure and Siemens Healthineers also recorded strong order growth year-over year. In Germany, Mobility posted sharp growth due to a higher volume from large orders that included a €1.5 billion order for high-speed trains. Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure also posted double-digit growth, while orders for Siemens Healthineers declined due mainly to lower volume from rapid coronavirus antigen tests.

Order intake in both the Americas region and in the U.S. showed a similar pattern: Smart Infrastructure, Digital Industries and Siemens Healthineers recorded double-digit growth, while orders in Mobility declined sharply on a lower volume from large orders which in the prior year included a €2.8 billion order in the U.S. In addition, order intake both in the region and in the U.S. was subject to significant positive currency translation effects, as well as strong portfolio effects which related primarily to the acquisition of Varian.

In the Asia, Australia region, order intake was up on double-digit increases in the majority of industrial businesses, with sharp growth at Digital Industries. The pattern of order development in China was largely the same as for the region. Overall, order intake both in the region and in China benefited clearly from positive currency translation effects.

1 As defined by the International Monetary Fund.

Revenue related to external customers rose in all four industrial businesses year-over-year, with the highest contributions coming from Siemens Healthineers. Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure recorded significant increases, while Mobility posted moderately higher revenue year-over-year. The revenue increase in emerging markets was driven by strong demand in China and, to a lesser degree in India.

Revenue in Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East increased with contributions from all four industrial businesses, led by significant growth at Digital Industries. Within the region, Germany showed clear growth driven by double-digit growth at Mobility and Digital Industries, while revenue at Siemens Healthineers declined significantly mainly due to lower volume from rapid coronavirus antigen tests.

In the Americas and in the U.S., revenue was up in all four industrial businesses with Siemens Healthineers, driven by a high demand from rapid coronavirus antigen tests, Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries reporting double-digit growth. As with orders, revenue was subject to strong positive currency translation effects and portfolio effects which related primarily to the acquisition of Varian.

In the Asia, Australia region, all four industrial businesses contributed to the revenue increase. As in the region, in China, the strong revenue growth was driven by Digital Industries, which recorded substantial growth. Revenue growth both in the region and in China benefited from strong positive currency translation effects.


### 4.2 Income

| Income tax expenses | (2,741) | (1,861) | (47)% |
| Income from continuing operations | 4,413 | 5,636 | (22)% |

| EPS pre PPA | 5.47 | 8.32 | (34)% |
| ROCE | 10.0% | 15.2% | |

As a result of the developments described in chapter 3, Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased by 5%. Severance charges for continuing operations were €272 million, of which €190 million were in Industrial Business. In fiscal 2021, severance charges for continuing operations were €410 million, of which €251 million were in Industrial Business.

Income from continuing operations decreased by 22%. The tax rate in fiscal 2022 was 38% (fiscal 2021: 25%), substantially impacted by the nontax-deductible impairment of the stake in Siemens Energy AG. Following the war in Ukraine, Siemens decided to exit business activities in Russia. Subsequent to this decision, Income from continuing operations was burdened by negative effects totaling €1.3 billion related to these activities primarily at Mobility, SFS and Corporate Treasury.

Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in fiscal 2021 included primarily a gain of €0.9 billion from the sale of Flender GmbH.

The decrease in Basic EPS and in EPS pre PPA reflects the decrease of Net income attributable to Shareholders of Siemens AG, which was €3,723 million in fiscal 2022 compared to €6,161 million in fiscal 2021.

The impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG burdened ROCE by 5.3 percentage points, resulting in a declined ROCE year-over-year which is below the target range set in our Siemens Financial Framework.


### 4.3 Research and development

In fiscal 2022, we reported research and development expenses of €5.6 billion, compared to €4.9 billion in fiscal 2021. The resulting R&D intensity, defined as the ratio of R&D expenses and revenue, was 7.8%, as in fiscal 2021. Additions to capitalized development expenses amounted to €0.3 billion as in the prior year. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, Siemens worldwide held approximately 43,600 granted patents in its continuing operations. On average, we had 46,900 R&D employees in fiscal 2022.

Our research and development activities are ultimately geared to developing innovative, sustainable solutions for our customers - and our businesses - while also strengthening our own competitiveness. Joint implementation by the operating units and Technology, our central R&D department, ensures that research activities and business strategies are closely aligned with one another, and that all units benefit equally and quickly from technological developments.

Siemens core technologies have been determined to be critical for our Company's long-term success and that of our customers and have been refocused in fiscal 2022 in eleven technology areas: additive manufacturing and materials, cybersecurity and trust, data analytics and artificial intelligence, power electronics, simulation and digital twin, sustainable energy and infrastructure, automation, integrated circuits and electronics, connectivity and edge, software systems and processes, and user experience.

We advance technologies also through our open innovation concept. We work closely with scholars from leading universities, research institutions and academic start-ups, not only under bilateral cooperation agreements but also in publicly funded collective projects. Our focus here is on our strategic research partners and in particular the Siemens Research and Innovation Ecosystems, which we maintain at 16 locations worldwide.

Siemens' global venture capital unit, Next47, provides capital to help start-ups expand and scale. It serves as the creator of next-generation businesses for Siemens by building, buying and partnering with innovative companies at any stage. Next47 is focused on anticipating how emerging technologies will influence our end markets. This foreknowledge enables our Company and our customers to grow and thrive in the age of digitalization.

| Total non-current assets | 92,673 | 87,074 | 6% |
| Total assets | 151,502 | 139,372 | 9% |

Our total assets at the end of fiscal 2022 were influenced by positive currency translation effects of €10.7 billion (particularly affecting goodwill, other intangible assets and other financial assets), primarily involving the U.S. dollar.

Both other current financial assets and other financial assets increased due mainly to higher loans receivable at SFS. The latter line item rose also due to increased positive fair values of derivative financial instruments, partly offset by effects related to the sale of Siemens' financing and leasing business in Russia.

Inventories increased in all industrial businesses, with the build-up most evident at Siemens Healthineers, Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure.

While the currency translation effects mentioned above resulted in an increase of goodwill and other intangible assets, another major factor was the acquisition of Brightly. The increase of other intangible assets resulted also from the acquisition of Sqills. For further information see Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.

The impairment on Siemens' 35% stake in Siemens Energy was the main factor for the decrease of investments accounted for using the equity method.

Deferred tax assets decreased due mainly to income tax effects related to remeasurement of defined benefits plans.

The decrease in other assets was driven mainly by lower net defined benefit assets, primarily from effects of asset ceiling.

| Non-controlling interests | 5,910 | 4,831 | 22% |
| Total liabilities and equity | 151,502 | 139,372 | 9% |

The decrease in short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt was due mainly to repayment of euro and U.S. dollar instruments totaling €6.1 billion. This was partly offset by reclassifications of long-term instruments totaling €4.5 billion.

Contract liabilities increased in all industrial businesses, with the build-up most evident at Siemens Healthineers, Digital Industries and Mobility.

Current income tax liabilities increased mainly due to future tax payments resulting from the sale of Siemens' mail and parcel-handling business, among other divestments.

Long-term debt increased due primarily to the issuance of euro instruments of €5.0 billion and currency translation effects for bonds issued in the U.S. dollar and British pound. Set against this were mainly decreases from the above-mentioned reclassifications.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations decreased mainly due to a higher discount rate. This effect was partially offset by a negative return on plan assets and inflation-related adjustments.

The increase of other financial liabilities resulted primarily from negative fair values of derivative financial instruments, which declined further.

The main factors for the increase in total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG were €3.7 billion in net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG; positive other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, of €5.8 billion resulting mainly from currency translation, partly offset by negative effects from remeasurements of defined benefit plans. The increase was partly offset by dividend payments of €3.2 billion (for fiscal 2021) and the repurchases of 14,185,791 treasury shares totaling €1.6 billion (including commission to a commissional bank).


### Capital structure ratio

Our capital structure ratio as of September 30, 2022 decreased to 1.0 from 1.5 a year earlier. The change was due to a decrease in Industrial net debt and a higher EBITDA.


#### Debt and credit facilities

As of September 30, 2022, we recorded, in total, €44.8 billion in notes and bonds, €2.7 billion in loans from banks, €0.1 billion in other financial indebtedness and €3.0 billion in lease liabilities. Notes and bonds were issued mainly in the U.S. dollar and euro, and to a lesser extent in the British pound.

We have credit facilities totaling €7.5 billion which were unused as of September 30, 2022.

For further information about our debt see Note 16 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022. For further information about the functions and objectives of our financial risk management see Note 25 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->


### Off-balance-sheet commitments

As of September 30, 2022, the undiscounted amount of maximum potential future payments related primarily to credit and performance guarantees amounted to €9.8 billion. This included primarily Siemens' obligations from performance and credit guarantees in connection with the Siemens Energy business, for which Siemens has reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.

In addition to these commitments, there are contingent liabilities of €0.4 billion which result mainly from other guarantees, legal proceedings and from joint and several liabilities of consortia. Other guarantees include €0.1 billion in connection with the Siemens Energy business, for which Siemens has reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.

Irrevocable loan commitments amounted to €4.0 billion. A considerable portion of these commitments resulted from asset-based lending transactions, meaning that the respective loans can be drawn only after the borrower has provided sufficient collateral.

For further information about our commitments and contingencies see Note 21 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.


### Share buyback

The share buyback program announced on June 24, 2021 with a volume of up to €3 billion ending September 15, 2026, at the latest, began on November 15, 2021. This buyback is executed based on the authorization provided by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020. In fiscal 2022, Siemens repurchased 14,185,791 shares under this share buyback program.

All industrial businesses recorded cash inflows from operating activities which exceed their profit, with the highest contribution from Digital Industries. Cash inflows from changes in operating net working capital were driven by Mobility.

Cash outflows from acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, were due mainly to the acquisitions of Brightly by Smart Infrastructure for €1.5 billion, including the settlement of debt, and Sqills by Mobility for €0.5 billion.

Cash outflows for purchase of investments and financial assets for investment purposes primarily included additions of assets eligible as central bank collateral and payments for debt or equity investments.

Cash outflows from change in receivables from financing activities of SFS related primarily to SFS' debt business.

Cash inflows from other disposals of assets mainly included proceeds of €1.1 billion from the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business by Portfolio Companies and €0.9 billion from the sale of Yunex Traffic by Mobility, as well as repayments of loans and disposals of assets eligible as central bank collateral.

Cash outflows from the re-issuance of treasury shares and other transactions with owners were driven by the purchase of Siemens Healthineers AG treasury shares.

<!-- PageNumber="18" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

Cash inflows from the change in short-term debt and other financing activities mainly included cash inflows related to the settlement of financial derivatives used to hedge currency exposure in our financing activities and from new bank loans, partly offset by cash outflows related to commercial paper.

Cash outflows for dividends attributable to non-controlling interests mainly included dividends paid to the shareholders of Siemens Healthineers AG.

With our ability to generate positive operating cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations of €10.2 billion in fiscal 2022, our total liquidity (defined as cash and cash equivalents plus current interest-bearing debt securities) of €11.7 billion, our unused lines of credit, and our credit ratings at year-end, we believe that we have sufficient flexibility to fund our capital requirements. Also in our opinion, our operating net working capital is sufficient for our present requirements.

| (II) Net income | | | 4,392 | | | 6,697 |
| (I) / (II) Cash conversion rate | | | 1.86 | | | 1.23 |

The cash conversion rate increased sharply primarily due to lower net income, which was burdened by a non-cash impairment of €2.7 billion on our stake in Siemens Energy AG.


### Investing activities

Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment from continuing operations totaled €2.1 billion in fiscal 2022. Within the industrial businesses, ongoing investments related mainly to technological innovations; maintaining, extending and digitalizing our capacities for designing, manufacturing and marketing new solutions; improving productivity; and replacements of fixed assets. These investments amounted to €1.5 billion in fiscal 2022. The remaining portion related mainly to Siemens Real Estate, including significant amounts for projects such as new office buildings in Germany. Siemens Real Estate is responsible for uniform and comprehensive management of Company real estate worldwide (except for Siemens Healthineers) and supports the industrial businesses and corporate activities with customer-specific real estate solutions.

With regard to capital expenditures for continuing operations, we expect a significant increase in fiscal 2023. In the coming years, up to €0.6 billion are to be invested in Siemensstadt Square. This project initiated in fiscal 2019 aims to transform Siemens' existing industrial area in Berlin into a modern urban district supporting a diverse range of purposes, including strengthening key technologies. Further investments are planned in relation to Siemens Campus Erlangen. In addition, we continue to invest in attractive innovation fields through Next47, our global venture capital unit.

7\. Overall assessment of the economic position
===

Fiscal 2022 was marked by geopolitical and economic turmoil, in particular by the war in Ukraine and its global repercussions, which further exacerbated already existing economic problems in many countries and which also affected Siemens. As a consequence of the war, Siemens decided to exit business activities in Russia. Despite strong global efforts in combating COVID-19, the pandemic continued to impact economic development worldwide, resulting in lockdowns particularly in China and affecting global supply and logistics chains. Our focus has been on successfully managing in this complex environment. In fiscal 2022, we saw accelerated demand in particular for our offerings in the areas of automation, digitalization, resource efficiency and decarbonization. We expect them to continue to be growth drivers in the coming years.

During the fiscal year, we made further progress in sharpening our business portfolio. On the divestment side, we sold the road-traffic business Yunex Traffic, our share in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive and the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics. On the acquisition side, we strengthened our industrial businesses through the acquisition of Sqills, a provider of cloud-based inventory management, reservation, and ticketing software for public transport operators. This acquisition enhances Mobility's existing offerings for increasing the availability, capacity and utilization of public transportation. We also strengthened Smart Infrastructure's presence in the market for the software used to manage built infrastructure through the acquisition of Brightly, a U.S .- based provider of cloud-based Software as a Service (Saas) for asset and maintenance management and for energy and sustainability management. As a significant further step in implementing our digitalization strategy, in June 2022 we launched Siemens Xcelerator, a digital business platform that includes a curated portfolio of IoT-enabled hardware, software and digital services from across Siemens and from certified third parties. Siemens Xcelerator facilitates interactions and transactions between customers, partners and developers and thus enables acceleration of the digital transformation of our customers of all sizes in industry, buildings, power transmission grids and mobility.

Siemens was very successful in fiscal 2022 despite the complex geopolitical and economic environment mentioned above. Many of our key customer industries including automotive, machine building, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, electronics, cloud services and public transport kept growing and we continued to successfully avoid major supply chain disruptions. However, tight supply and logistics chains led to extended delivery times for some automation products, while effects related to COVID-19, mainly including medical leave for employees, impacted some of our own production capacity. Our Industrial Business again achieved excellent results, particularly in Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Siemens Healthineers. Results at Mobility were strongly burdened by negative effects for winding down business activities in Russia. Outside Industrial Business, exiting financing and leasing activities in Russia resulted in further charges, burdening results in Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements and SFS. Also outside Industrial Business, a significant decline in the market value of Siemens Energy AG led to an impairment of our stake in the company; as a consequence, after the third quarter of fiscal 2022 we had to revise the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2021 for EPS pre PPA to include the earnings effect of the impairment.

Orders rose 25% year-over-year to €89.0 billion, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.24, thus fulfilling our expectation of a ratio above 1. All our four industrial businesses increased orders year-over-year. Order growth was led by substantial increases at Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure. Orders at Siemens Healthineers also rose substantially and included new orders from the acquisition of Varian. Mobility, which won large contracts in both periods under review, among them an order worth €1.5 billion for high-speed trains in Germany in fiscal 2022, increased order intake moderately year-over-year. Overall, order growth benefited from positive currency translation effects.

Revenue was also higher in all our industrial businesses, rising to €72.0 billion, a 16% increase year-over-year, which included positive currency translation effects. Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Siemens Healthineers contributed double-digit growth. Revenue growth at Digital Industries was driven mainly by the automation businesses, while in its software business a high rate of customer acceptance of the PLM SaaS transition reduced current license revenue in favor of recurring future subscription revenue. Revenue at Smart Infrastructure rose on contributions from all businesses, led by the electrical products business. At Siemens Healthineers, revenue also grew in all businesses and included positive portfolio effects. Revenue at Mobility rose moderately, as revenue development was held back by supplier delays in delivering materials and components and by effects related to COVID-19. Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens grew 8.2%. We thus exceeded the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2021, which was to achieve mid-single-digit comparable revenue growth, and also exceeded our subsequent guidance provided in the Half-year Financial Report 2022, which was to achieve 6% to 8% in comparable revenue growth.

Profit Industrial Business rose 17% to a record-high €10.3 billion. All industrial businesses except Mobility increased their profit year-over- year. The strongest increase came from Smart Infrastructure on improvements in all its businesses. Higher profit at Siemens Healthineers included another strong contribution from the rapid coronavirus antigen testing business in the diagnostics business. Profit growth at Digital Industries was driven by the automation businesses, only partly offset by a decline in profit in the software business due mainly to higher expenses related to cloud-based activities. Profit at Mobility came in lower due mainly to negative effects for winding down business activities in Russia totaling €0.6 billion and also to burdens from supplier delays and COVID-19 effects, only partly offset by a €0.7 billion gain from the sale of Yunex Traffic.

Our Industrial Business generated a strong profit margin of 15.1%, up slightly from 15.0% a year earlier. This increase was due to Smart Infrastructure which improved its profit margin to 12.8%. Digital Industries and Siemens Healthineers contributed the highest margins with 19.9% and 15.5%, respectively, while the profit margin for Mobility came in at 8.2%.

Earnings before taxes at SFS declined moderately as higher earnings from the equity business were more than offset by decreased results in the debt business, including a €0.2 billion impact in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business in Russia. Return on equity after tax for SFS was 15.6%. Profit for Portfolio Companies included a €1.1 billion gain from the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics and a €0.3 billion revaluation gain in connection with the sale of our stake in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH. Results within Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements were burdened by a €2.7 billion impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG and a €0.5 billion impact resulting from the sale of Siemens' financing and leasing business in Russia.

Despite the excellent performance of our Industrial Business, net income in fiscal 2022 declined to €4.4 billion, down from €6.7 billion a year earlier in which discontinued operations contributed income of €1.1 billion largely related to the sale of Flender. The successful further focusing of our portfolio in fiscal 2022 resulted in income of €2.2 billion, including the above-mentioned gains related to the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics and Yunex Traffic; this figure exceeded the €1.5 billion in such income a year earlier, including the gain from the sale of Flender. Nevertheless, positive results from divestments were more than offset by the €2.7 billion

impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG and a negative €1.3 billion following our decision to exit business activities in Russia, as mentioned above. Basic EPS from net income came in at €4.65 and EPS pre PPA was €5.47. Due particularly to the impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG, which burdened basic EPS from net income and EPS pre PPA each by €3.37 per share, we did not reach the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2021, which was to achieve EPS pre PPA in a range of €8.70 to €9.10; we did achieve our forecast revised after the third quarter of fiscal 2022, which was for EPS pre PPA in a range of €5.33 to €5.73.

The impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG burdened ROCE by 5.3 percentage points, resulting in ROCE of 10.0% for fiscal 2022, below our forecast given in the Combined Management Report 2021, which was for ROCE to improve in our target range of 15% to 20%.

We evaluate our capital structure using the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA. Due to a combination of a decrease in Industrial net debt and higher EBITDA year-over-year, this ratio declined to 1.0. We thus achieved the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report 2021, which was to achieve a ratio below the prior-year figure of 1.5.

Free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal 2022 was €8.2 billion, on the high level of a year earlier. The cash conversion rate for Siemens, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to Net income, was 1.86, exceeding our targeted cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate for Siemens.

We intend to continue providing an attractive shareholder return. The Siemens Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, proposes a dividend of €4.25 per share, up from €4.00 per share a year earlier.

8\. Report on expected developments and associated material opportunities and risks
===


## 8.1 Report on expected developments


### 8.1.1 Worldwide economy

After a dynamic start in calendar 2022, the global economy experienced a substantial slowdown in the course the year, mainly due to the war in Ukraine, spiraling energy prices and very high inflation rates. Several regions were expected to be already in or on the verge of a recession at the end of calendar 2022. Calendar 2023 is likely to be a year of economic headwinds, with GDP in Europe and the U.S. contracting slightly and global GDP expanding by only 1.5%. The outlook is subject to an extraordinarily high level of uncertainty.

The EU's economic output is expected to decline by 0.5% in calendar 2023. This assumes that the war in Ukraine does not escalate further. Energy prices, which increased dramatically in calendar 2022, should remain at a high level but ease further compared with the highs of summer 2022. Germany is likely to see a somewhat more significant decline in GDP (-1.0%) due to its high dependence on Russian energy supplies.

In the USA, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise the key policy interest rate to almost 5% in calendar 2023 in order to bring inflation back down to the target level of 2%. The ECB is expected to raise its main refinancing rate to almost 3% in calendar 2023. Rising financing costs will likely cause residential and commercial construction to decline. Investment in property, plant and equipment and software is expected to weaken. Consumer spending is expected to increase slightly, while spending on services is expected to increase more significantly than spending on goods - thus the shift from services to products triggered by COVID-19 should continue to reverse and spending patterns normalize. Economic output is expected to contract slightly by 0.2% in calendar 2023.

Economic growth in China is expected to accelerate only slightly in calendar 2023, after the COVID-19 lockdowns and the housing sector crisis already weighed on GDP growth in calendar 2022 (+3%). The impact of the necessary adjustments in China's real estate sector, the limited benefit of stimulus packages due to concerns about high debt levels, and weakening export demand are together expected to limit China's GDP growth to 4.4% in calendar 2023.

Having probably peaked in calendar 2022, inflation is expected to weaken slightly in calendar 2023. In the USA, consumer price inflation is estimated at 4.3% in calendar 2023, down from 8.1% in calendar 2022. In the EU, inflation is still expected to be 6.5% (down from 9% in calendar 2022). Producer prices, which are more volatile than consumer prices and run ahead of them, are expected to fall by 5.4% in the USA in calendar 2023 (after an increase of 16.8% in calendar 2022), while they are still expected to rise by 5.4% in the EU (after 30.4% in calendar 2022).

Overall, the macroeconomic environment is likely to be challenging for Siemens in fiscal 2023 given the economic headwinds. For example, global fixed capital formation is expected to grow by only 1.7% in calendar 2023, down from 2.7% in calendar 2022. However, two effects are expected to provide significant support to our customer markets in fiscal 2023: Firstly, key customer sectors should be supported by the still very high order backlogs and work them off as supply and logistics chains ease. In this context, the infrastructure sector should continue to benefit from various (green) stimulus programs. On the other hand, producer prices are rising, which means that higher costs are being passed on to customers, at least in part. These higher prices also contribute to nominal (not price-adjusted) growth in customer markets in fiscal 2023.

The forecasts presented here for GDP and fixed investments are based on a report from S&P Global dated November 15, 2022.


### 8.1.2 Siemens Group

We are basing our outlook for fiscal 2023 on the above-mentioned expectations and assumptions regarding the overall economic situation and also on the specific market conditions we expect for our respective industrial businesses, as described in chapter 3 Segment information. Furthermore, we assume that geopolitical tensions do not further escalate and challenges from COVID-19 and supply chain constraints continue to ease. We expect continued impacts from higher prices for raw materials and components and from wage increases, which we intend to cover with improved productivity and by adjusting prices for our own products, solutions and services, particularly at Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure.

We are exposed to currency translation effects, mainly involving the U.S. dollar, the British pound and currencies of emerging markets, particularly the Chinese yuan. While we expect volatility in global currency markets to continue in fiscal 2023, we have improved our natural hedge on a global basis through geographic distribution of our production facilities in the past. Additionally, Siemens is still a net exporter from the Eurozone to the rest of the world, so a weak euro is principally favorable for our business and a strong euro is principally unfavorable. In addition to the natural hedging strategy just mentioned, we also hedge currency risk in our export business using derivative financial instruments. We expect these steps to help us limit effects on income related to currency in fiscal 2023. In this outlook, we assume that currency translation effects in fiscal 2023 do not significantly influence nominal volume growth rates for our businesses.

This outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters and material impairments.

Segments

With our high order backlog, particularly in short-cycle businesses, we expect our industrial businesses to continue their profitable growth. Digital Industries expects for fiscal 2023 to achieve comparable revenue growth of 10% to 13%. The profit margin is expected to be 19% to 22%.

Smart Infrastructure expects for fiscal 2023 comparable revenue growth of 8% to 11%. The profit margin is expected to be 13% to 14%. Mobility expects for fiscal 2023 comparable revenue growth of 6% to 9%. The profit margin is expected to be 8% to 10%.

<!-- PageNumber="22" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

Siemens Healthineers expects to achieve comparable revenue development between (1)% and 1% in fiscal 2023. Siemens Healthineers is expected to contribute solidly to the profit and profit margin of our Industrial Business.

Siemens Financial Services expects Earnings before taxes in fiscal 2023 close to the prior-year level. Return on equity (ROE) (after tax) is expected to be at the lower end of the target range of 15% to 20%.


#### Revenue growth

For comparable revenue, we expect the Siemens Group to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of 6% to 9%. Furthermore, we anticipate that orders in fiscal 2023 will exceed revenue for a book-to-bill ratio above 1.

As of September 30, 2022, our order backlog totaled €102 billion, and we expect conversion from the backlog to strongly support revenue growth in fiscal 2023 with approximately €45 billion of past orders converted to current revenue. For expected conversion of order backlog to revenue for our respective segments, see chapter 3 Segment information.


### Profitability

Outside our reportable segments, we expect profit at Portfolio Companies of €0.3 billion in fiscal 2023, including a substantial contribution from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business, which closed at the beginning of fiscal 2023.

Furthermore, within Siemens Energy Investment, we expect amortization of assets resulting from purchase price allocation due to the initial recognition of the investment at fair value in September 2020, to be €0.1 billion in fiscal 2023. In addition, Siemens Energy Investment includes further effects from at-equity accounting, such as our share in Siemens Energy's profit (loss) after tax. We anticipate that Siemens Real Estate will continue with real estate disposals depending on market conditions, at a similar level as in fiscal 2022. Results for Innovation also are expected on the prior-year level, which was a negative €0.2 billion. Results related to Governance were a negative €0.6 billion in fiscal 2022; we expect an improvement in fiscal 2023, to a negative €0.5 billion. Centrally carried pension expense are expected to be on the prior-year level, which was a negative €0.1 billion. Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, which was €1.0 billion in fiscal 2022, is expected at €0.9 billion in fiscal 2023. Financing, eliminations and other items, which were a negative €0.5 billion in fiscal 2022, are expected in a range between a negative €0.5 billion and a negative €0.6 billion.

We anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of 26% to 31%, compared to 38% in fiscal 2022. This assumption does not take into consideration possible impacts from potential major tax reforms. We do not expect material influence on financial results from discontinued operations in fiscal 2023.

Our forecast for net income takes into account a number of additional factors. We assume solid project execution to continue in fiscal 2023. We plan to increase the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, which was 7.8% in fiscal 2022, to approximately 8% with a strong focus on software and digital technologies. Severance charges, which were €0.3 billion in fiscal 2022, are expected at a similar level in fiscal 2023. While gains from executing our portfolio improvement program contributed €2.2 billion to net income in fiscal 2022, we expect a sharply lower contribution from such gains in fiscal 2023.

Given the above-mentioned assumptions, we expect profitable growth of our industrial businesses to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA to a range of €8.70 to €9.20 in fiscal 2023, along with a corresponding increase in net income.

Capital efficiency

For fiscal 2023, we expect ROCE, to come close to or reach the lower end of our target range of 15% to 20%.


## Capital structure

We aim in general for a capital structure, defined as the ratio of industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations), of up to 1.5 and expect to achieve this in fiscal 2023.


## Cash conversion rate

For fiscal 2023, we expect a cash conversion rate that contributes to reaching our target of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate of Siemens over a cycle of three to five years.


## 8.1.3 Overall assessment

Our outlook for fiscal 2023 is based on the assumptions that geopolitical tensions do not further escalate and challenges from COVID-19 and supply chain constraints continue to ease. Under these conditions, with our high order backlog, particularly in short-cycle businesses, we expect our industrial businesses to continue their profitable growth.

For the Siemens Group we expect comparable revenue growth in the range of 6% to 9% and a book-to-bill ratio above 1.

We expect this profitable growth of our industrial businesses to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA to a range of €8.70 to €9.20 in fiscal 2023. This outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters and material impairments.

Overall, the actual development for Siemens and its segments may vary, positively or negatively, from our outlook due to the risks and opportunities described below or if our expectations and assumptions do not materialize.


## 8.2 Risk management


### 8.2.1 Basic principles of risk management

Our risk management policy stems from a philosophy of pursuing sustainable growth and creating economic value while managing appropriate risks and opportunities and avoiding inappropriate risks. As risk management is an integral part of how we plan and execute our business strategies, our risk management policy is set by the Managing Board. Our organizational and accountability structure requires

<!-- PageNumber="23" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

each of the respective managements of our organizational units to implement risk management programs that are tailored to their specific industries and responsibilities, while being consistent with the overall policy.


### 8.2.2 Enterprise risk management process

We have implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems which support us in the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business. The most important of these systems include our enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning is intended to support us in considering potential risks and opportunities well in advance of major business decisions, while management reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our risk management and its contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our internal audit function. Accordingly, if deficits are detected, it is possible to adopt appropriate measures for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.

Risk management at Siemens builds on a comprehensive, interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach that is integrated into the organization and that addresses both risks and opportunities. Our ERM approach is based on the globally accepted COSO Standard (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Performance (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process, our internal control and compliance management system. They consider a company's strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.

Our ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of, and response regarding, risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective measures and controls. If risks have already been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the consolidated financial statements (e.g. as a provision or risk contingency), they are supposed to be incorporated with their financial impact in the entity's business objectives. As a consequence, only additional risks arising from the same subject (e.g. deviations from business objectives, different impact perspectives) should be considered. In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle; we complement this periodic reporting with an ad-hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and opportunities are evaluated in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective managements of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant. Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above.

Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to "seize" the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management. Accordingly, we have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks in order to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses. Among others, we address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries, and by adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary. Due to regular screening of climate risks and environmental, social and governance (ESG) developments we can initiate related mitigation actions in a timely manner as part of our DEGREE implementation. Worldwide there are risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic or other infectious developments such as bioterrorism to cause high disease rates in countries, regions or continents. We constantly check information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. and Europe, the Robert Koch Institute in Germany and other institutions in order to be able to identify early epidemic or pandemic risks and determine and initiate related mitigation actions as early as possible.


### 8.2.3 Risk management organization and responsibilities

To oversee the ERM process and to further drive the integration and harmonization of existing control activities to align with legal and operational requirements, the Managing Board established a Risk Management and Internal Control Organization, led by the Head of Assurance. In order to allow for a meaningful discussion of risk at the Siemens Group level, this organization aggregates individual risks and opportunities of similar cause-and-effect nature into broader risk and opportunity themes. This aggregation naturally results in a mixture of risks, including those with a primarily qualitative assessment and those with a primarily quantitative risk assessment. Accordingly, we do not adopt a purely quantitative assessment of risk and opportunity themes. Thematic risk and opportunity assessments as well as our risk-bearing capacity then form the basis for the evaluation of the company-wide risk and opportunity situation during the quarterly Managing Board meetings. The Head of Assurance assists the Managing Board with the operation and oversight of the risk and internal control system and reporting to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.

## 8.3 Risks

Below we describe the risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition (including effects on assets, liabilities and cash flows), results of operations and reputation. The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four categories reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these risks and thus provides an indication of the risks' current importance to us. Additional risks not known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business objectives and operations. Unless otherwise stated, the risks described below relate to all our organizational units.


### 8.3.1 Strategic risks

Economic, political and geopolitical conditions: We see high uncertainties regarding the global economic and geopolitical outlook, which deteriorated significantly in the past year due to multiple headwinds, all of which may continue to intensify. First and foremost, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its political and economic consequences, such as sanctions and countermeasures, result in far-reaching risks. War in Ukraine may have a negative impact on sales development, production processes as well as purchasing and logistics processes, for example through interruptions in supply chains and energy supplies or bottlenecks affecting components, raw materials and intermediate products. The conflict could also intensify further to the point of expanding to include other warring parties, including NATO countries, and the use of unconventional weapons. An expansion of the war would have a significant impact on the Siemens market environment. But even the current state of war could have a further negative impact on economic development if potential energy supply shortfalls make rationing necessary in industry and households or even result in blackouts during the next months. This would fuel already high inflation, with further risk of a sustained wage-price-spiral. In any case one of the core risks for the Siemens outlook is that central banks may fail to get inflation under control and have then to react even more restrictively. Alternatively, central banks may overreact, which could lead to rapid monetary tightening. More restrictive financial conditions would likely push advanced economies into recession and pose a significant risk to vulnerable emerging economies. Highly indebted (emerging and industrialized) countries could suffer from increasing financing costs, further U.S. dollar appreciation, and loss of investor confidence. Other risks could arise for the stability of public finances and the banking sector. Further risks are coming from other geopolitical tensions (particularly associated with Ukraine, the Baltics, Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans, China, Taiwan, and Iran). Recent, electoral results within the European Union may make cooperation and implementation of reforms more difficult. Obstruction and redefinitions of international cooperation could severely impact our business. First and foremost a aggravating U.S .- China decoupling would have adverse effects on confidence and investment activity and would severely hit Siemens' business. Increasing trade barriers, protectionism, sanctions and in particular technical regulations would negatively impact production costs and productivity along our global value chains, as well as significantly impede or even hinder access to sales markets. Even though the latest virus variants have seemed less dangerous, the COVID-19 pandemic is still taking a toll on global economic activity, in particular due to the strict "zero-COVID" policy in China with potential spillovers to the global economy (e.g., further tightening supply chain bottlenecks). But also, the evolution of more aggressive and lethal variants remains a key risk for the global economy. We have additional business risk from further weakening of Chinese economic growth. The ongoing crisis in China's real estate sector poses a threat to China's economic outlook, with potential spillovers to the global economy. A significant risk to our sales potential and cost structure is coming from potential supply chain bottlenecks, due to growing lack of availability of intermediate goods, in particular electronic components. We are dependent on the economic development of certain industries; a continuation or even an intensification of the cyclical and structural headwinds in core customer industries, e.g., automotive or construction, would have adverse impact on our business prospects. A terrorist attack, an escalation of conflicts like in the Ukraine or elsewhere or a significant cybercrime incident, or a series of such attacks or incidents in major economies, could depress economic activity globally and undermine consumer and business confidence. Additionally, the highly interconnected global economy remains vulnerable to natural disasters, further pandemics or hybrid warfare.

In general, due to long-cycle businesses in our organizational units and the importance of long-term contracts for Siemens, there is usually a time lag between changes in macroeconomic conditions and their impact on our financial results. In contrast, short-cycle business activities react quickly to volatility in market demand. If the moderate growth of certain markets stalls again and if we are not successful in adapting our production and cost structure to subsequent changes in conditions in the markets in which we operate, there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects. For example, our customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products, solutions and services, or fail to follow through on purchases or contracts already executed. Furthermore, the prices for our products, solutions and services may decline to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. In addition, it may become more difficult for our customers to obtain financing. Contracted payment terms, especially regarding the level of advance payments by our customers relating to long-term projects, may become less favorable, which could negatively impact our financial condition. Siemens' global setup with operations in almost all relevant economies, our wide range of offerings with varied exposures to business cycles, and our balanced mix of business models (e.g., equipment, components, systems, software, services and solutions) help us to absorb impacts from adverse developments in any single market.

Disruptive technologies: The markets in which our businesses operate experience rapid and significant changes due to the introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies. In the fields of digitalization (e.g. IoT, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, industrial metaverse), there are risks associated with new competitors, substitutions for existing products/solutions/services, new business models (e.g. in terms of pricing, financing, extended scopes for project business or subscription models in the software business) and finally the risk that our competitors may have more advanced time-to-market strategies and introduce their disruptive products and solutions faster than Siemens. Our operating results depend to a significant extent on our technological leadership, our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in our markets and to optimize our cost base accordingly. Introducing new products and technologies requires a significant commitment to research and development, which in return requires expenditure of considerable financial resources that may not always result in success. Our results of operations may suffer if we invest in technologies that do not operate or may not be integrated as expected, or that are not accepted in the marketplace as anticipated, or if our products, solutions or systems are not introduced to the market in a timely manner, particularly compared to our competitors, or even become obsolete. We constantly apply for new patents and actively manage our intellectual property portfolio to secure our technological position. However, our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services that are similar to ours.

Increasing sustainability focus: The increasing ESG-requirements from governments, investors and customers as well as financing restrictions for greenhouse gas emitting technologies could result in additional costs. The growing requirements in the regulatory

<!-- PageNumber="25" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

environment, but also the self-commitment to own sustainability and climate protection targets, bear further liability risks. Additionally, business involvement in areas of public debate regarding sustainability might be negatively perceived and trigger adverse media attention. This could lead to reputational damage and have an impact on achievement of our business goals. We address these risks, among other things, in the context of our sustainability framework DEGREE, in which we have also set ourselves ambitious sustainability targets. Measures to reduce climate-related risks include, for example, our decarbonization strategy (including Science Based Target), as well as our engagement in the supply chain. In fiscal 2021, we introduced an ESG risk framework along with an optimized ESG due diligence process. This supports Siemens businesses with due diligence in the customer-oriented environment with a view to possible environmental and social risks as well as related human rights and reputational risks.

COVID-19: Compared to the first years of the pandemic, we are seeing a recovery in many business sectors, and travel has also normalized in many areas. The availability of vaccines has improved, although their effectiveness against emerging virus variants cannot yet be conclusively assessed. Nevertheless, regional lockdowns may continue to be the result. The extent and duration of individual impacts on our business are difficult to predict. For example, if measures to the virus are initiated at short notice or last an unpredictably long time, our business may be significantly impacted in ways that exceed current expectations and go beyond mitigation measures already in place. We could face unexpected closures of sites, factories or office buildings of our suppliers, customers or our own operations, which would affect our ability to produce or deliver our products, solutions and services. The longer such restrictive measures (e.g. curfews) last, the deeper the resulting consequences will be. Possible consequences include an unchecked increase of public and private debt which hampers the post-crisis recovery, serious disruptions in the financial system, and insolvencies among Siemens customers and suppliers. In the long term, a reversal of globalization could reduce the potential for future growth. Various task forces and crisis teams in all functional areas of Siemens continue to closely monitor COVID-19 events and engage in active mitigation activities if required.

Competitive environment: The worldwide markets for our products, solutions and services are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms and shifts in market demands. We face strong, established competitors as well as rising competitors from emerging markets and new industries, which may have a better cost structure. Some industries in which we operate are undergoing consolidation, which may result in stronger competition, a change in our relative market position, an increase in inventory of finished or work-in-progress goods, or unexpected price erosion. Furthermore, there is a risk that critical suppliers could be taken over by competitors and a risk that competitors are increasingly offering services to our installed base. We address these risks with various measures, for example benchmarking, strategic initiatives, sales push initiatives, executing productivity measures and target cost projects, rightsizing of our footprint, outsourcings, mergers and joint ventures and optimizing our product and service portfolio. We continuously monitor and analyze competitive, market and industry information in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely reacting to such changes.

Portfolio measures, at-equity investments, other investments and strategic alliances: Our strategy includes divesting our activities in some business areas and strengthening others through portfolio measures, including mergers and acquisitions. With respect to divestments, we may not be able to divest some of our activities as planned, and the divestitures we do carry out could have a negative impact on our business situation, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky because of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. There can be no assurance that any of the businesses we acquire can be integrated successfully and in a timely manner as originally planned, or that they will perform as anticipated once integrated. In addition, we may incur significant acquisition, administrative, tax and other expenditures in connection with these transactions, including costs related to integration of acquired businesses. Furthermore, portfolio measures may result in additional financing needs and adversely affect our capital structure. Acquisitions can lead to substantial additions to intangible assets, including goodwill, in our statements of financial position. If we were to encounter continuing adverse business developments or if we were otherwise to perform worse than expected at acquisition activities, then these intangible assets, including goodwill, might have to be impaired, which could adversely affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. Our investment portfolio includes investments held for purposes other than trading and other investments. Any factors negatively influencing the financial condition and results of operations of our at-equity investments and other investments could have an adverse effect on our equity pick- up related to these investments or may result in a related write-off. In addition, our business situation, financial condition and results of operations could also be adversely affected in connection with loans, guarantees or non-compliance with financial covenants related to these investments. Furthermore, such investments are inherently risky as we may not be able to sufficiently influence corporate governance processes or business decisions taken by our at-equity investments, other investments and strategic alliances, which may have a negative effect on our business and especially on our reputation. In addition, joint ventures bear the risk of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. Strategic alliances may also pose risks for us because we compete in some business areas with companies with which we have strategic alliances. Besides other measures, we handle these risks with standardized processes as well as dedicated roles and responsibilities in the areas of mergers, acquisitions, divestments and carve-outs. This includes the systematic treatment of all contractual obligations and post-closing claims.


### 8.3.2 Operational risks

Cyber/Information security: Digital technologies are deeply integrated into our business portfolio. Further integration of information technology into products and services in conjunction with changing business strategies (such as outsourcing, globally distributed development, a lesser degree of sole production) are leading to an increasingly distributed supply chain, making efficient controls difficult. The fact of a large number of suppliers requires a significant effort for the initial and regular verification of the effective implementation of cybersecurity requirements by suppliers. Siemens business entities might lose market access if their products, solutions and services do not comply with increased regulations and legal requirements for cybersecurity in their respective countries. We observe a global increase of cybersecurity threats and higher levels of professionalism in computer crime, which pose a risk to the security of products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data. According to external sources of relevant data this trend has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Especially the numbers of phishing attacks and malicious websites have increased significantly. Moreover, the information technology market is concentrated among a small number of information technology and software vendors, which could lead to dependence on a single provider. There can be no assurance that the measures aimed at protecting our intellectual property and portfolio will address these threats under all circumstances. There is a risk that confidential information or data privacy-relevant information may be stolen or that the integrity of our portfolio may be compromised,

<!-- PageNumber="26" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

e.g. by attacks on our networks, social engineering, data manipulations in critical applications and a loss of critical resources, resulting in financial damages and violating the data privacy laws. Cybersecurity covers the IT of our entire enterprise including office IT, systems and applications, special-purpose networks, and our operating environments such as manufacturing and research and development (R&D). Like other large multinational companies, we face active cyber threats from sophisticated adversaries that are supported by organized crime and nation-states engaged in economic espionage or even sabotage. We strive to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, considering new models of flexible working environments, and comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems through cyber defense with an artificial intelligence solution to identify attacks faster and prevent damage to society and to critical infrastructures, our customers, our partners and Siemens overall. We initiated the industrial "Charter of Trust," signed by a growing group of global companies, which sets out principles for building trust in digital technologies and creating a more secure digital world. Nonetheless, our systems, products, solutions and services, as well as those of our service providers, remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Such attacks could potentially lead to the publication, manipulation or leakage of information such as through industrial espionage. They could also result in deliberate improper use of our systems, vulnerable products, production downtimes and supply shortages, with potential adverse effects on our reputation, our competitiveness and results of operations. We might lose market access if our products, solutions and services do not comply with local regulations and requirements for cybersecurity. For increased protection of Siemens and reduction of a potential financial impact caused by cyber incidents, the risk transfer possibilities have been evaluated. As a result of an international insurance tender, the currently insurable cybersecurity risks have been to a partial extent transferred to a consortium of insurance companies.

Supply chain management: The financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain management for components, sub-assemblies, energy, critical parts (e.g. semiconductors) and materials. Capacity constraints and supply shortages resulting from ineffective supply chain management may lead to production bottlenecks, delivery delays, quality issues and additional costs. We also rely on third parties to supply us with parts, components and services. Using third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products may reduce our control over manufacturing yields, quality assurance, product delivery schedules and costs. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid supply-related problems, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter supply problems in the future, especially if we use single-source suppliers for critical components. Shortages and delays could materially harm our businesses. Unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due to market shortages or other reasons could also adversely affect performance. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the risk of delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a consequence of catastrophic events (including pandemics), geopolitical uncertainties, energy shortages, sabotage, cyber incidents or suppliers' financial difficulties, particularly if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply or means of transportation in a timely manner or at all. Besides other measures, we mitigate price fluctuation in global raw material markets with various hedging instruments.

Internal programs and initiatives: We are in a continuous process of operational optimization and constantly engage in cost-reduction initiatives, including ongoing capacity adjustment measures and structural initiatives. Consolidation of business activities and manufacturing facilities, outsourcings, joint ventures and the streamlining of product portfolios are all part of these cost-reduction efforts. These measures may not be implemented as planned, may turn out to be less effective than anticipated, may become effective later than estimated or may not become effective at all. Any future contribution of these measures to our profitability will be influenced by the actual savings achieved and by our ability to sustain them. In case of restructuring and outsourcing activities, there could be delays in product deliveries or we might even experience delivery failures. Furthermore, delays in critical R&D projects could lead to negative impacts in running projects. We constantly control and monitor the progress of these projects and initiatives using standardized controlling and milestone tracking approaches.

Project-related risks: A number of our segments conduct activities under long-term contracts that are awarded on a competitive bidding basis. Such contracts typically arise at Mobility and in various activities of Smart Infrastructure or Portfolio Companies. Some of these contracts are inherently risky because we may assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing a project and meeting post- completion warranty obligations. For example, we may face the risk that we must satisfy technical requirements of a project even though we have not gained experience with those requirements before winning the project. The profit margins realized on fixed-priced contracts may vary from original estimates as a result of changes in costs and productivity over a contract's term. We sometimes bear the risk of unanticipated project modifications, shortage of key personnel, quality problems, financial difficulties of our customers and/or significant partners, cost overruns or contractual penalties caused by unexpected technological problems, unexpected developments at the project sites, unforeseen changes or difficulties in the regulatory or political environment, performance problems with our suppliers, subcontractors and consortium partners or other logistical difficulties. Some of our multi-year contracts also contain demanding installation and maintenance requirements in addition to other performance criteria relating to timing, unit cost and compliance with government regulations, which, if not satisfied, could subject us to substantial contractual penalties, damages, non-payment and contract termination. There can be no assurance that contracts and projects, in particular those with long-term duration and fixed-price calculation, can be completed profitably. To tackle those risks, we established a global project management organization to systematically improve the technical and commercial capabilities of our project management personnel. For very complex projects we conduct dedicated risk assessments in very early stages of the sales phase before we decide to hand over a binding offer to our customers.

Shortage of skilled personnel: Competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel (e.g. specialists, experts, digital talent) remains intense in the industries and regions in which our businesses operate. We have ongoing demand for highly skilled employees and a need to enhance diversity, inclusion and sense of belonging in our workforce. Our future success depends in part on our continued ability to identify, assess and hire engineers, digital talent and other qualified personnel. We must also integrate, develop and retain them after they join us, which appears especially relevant in times of a new, increasingly virtual working environment. We address these topics for example by strengthening the capabilities and skills of our talent acquisition teams and a strategy of proactive search for people with the required capabilities in our respective industries and markets. Starting in fiscal 2023 we will roll out our new Employer Branding activities with focus on hard-to-fill positions in our key markets. Technology and digitalization help us to be more effective in attracting and selecting diverse talent. In addition, we have a focus on diversity and structured succession planning.


#### 8.3.3 Financial risks

Risks from pension obligations: The provisions for pensions and similar obligations may be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, as well as by movements in financial markets or a change in the mix of assets in our investment portfolio. Additionally, they are subject to legal risks with regard to plan design, among other factors. A significant increase in underfunding may

<!-- PageNumber="27" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

have a negative effect on our capital structure and rating, and thus may tighten refinancing options and increase costs. In order to comply with local pension regulations in selected foreign countries, we may face an economic risk of increasing cash outflows due to changes in funding level according to local regulations of our pension plans in these countries or to changes in the regulations themselves.

Audits by tax authorities and changes in tax regulations: We operate in nearly all countries of the world and therefore are subject to many different tax regulations. Changes in tax laws in any of these jurisdictions could result in higher tax expenses and increased tax payments. Furthermore, legislative changes could impact our tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the uncertain legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights. As a globally operating organization, we conduct business in countries subject to complex tax rules, which may be interpreted in different ways. Future interpretations or developments of tax regimes may affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. We are regularly audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions and we continuously identify and assess relevant risks.

Market price risks: We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and the euro, because a high percentage of our business volume is conducted as exports from Europe to regions using the U.S. dollar. In addition, we are exposed to effects involving the currencies of emerging markets, in particular the Chinese yuan. Appreciable changes in euro exchange rates could materially change our competitive position. We are also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. Even hedging activities to mitigate such risks may result in a reverse effect. Fluctuations in exchange or interest rates, negative developments in the financial markets and changes in central bank policies could therefore negatively impact our financial results. Market prices show higher volatility than before due to increased macroeconomic uncertainties (e.g. resulting from inflation, COVID-19, war in Ukraine).

Liquidity and financing risks: Our treasury and financing activities could face adverse deposit and/or financing conditions from negative developments related to financial markets, such as limited availability of funds and hedging instruments, an updated evaluation of our solvency, particularly from rating agencies, negative interest rates, and impacts arising from more restrictive regulation of the financial sector, central bank policy, or the usage of financial instruments. Widening credit spreads due to uncertainty and risk aversion in the financial markets might lead to adverse changes in the market values of our financial assets, in particular our derivative financial instruments.

Credit risks: We provide our customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing of orders and projects, including guarantees. Siemens Financial Services in particular bears credit risks due to such financing activities if, for example, customers do not meet obligations arising from these financing arrangements, meet them only partially, or meet them late. The credit environment has become more dynamic due to a more uncertain macroeconomic outlook (e.g. inflation) and geopolitical tensions.

For further information on post-employment benefits, derivative financial instruments, hedging activities, financial risk management and related measures, see Notes 17, 24 and 25 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.


#### 8.3.4 Compliance risks

Current and future investigations regarding allegations of corruption, of antitrust violations and of other violations of law: Proceedings against us or our business partners regarding allegations of corruption, of antitrust violations and of other violations of law may lead to fines as well as penalties, sanctions, injunctions against future conduct, profit disgorgements, disqualifications from directly and indirectly engaging in certain types of business, the loss of business licenses or permits, other restrictions and legal consequences as well as negative public media coverage. Accordingly, we may, among other things, be required to comply with potential obligations and liabilities arising in connection with such investigations and proceedings, including potential tax penalties. Moreover, any findings related to public corruption that are not covered by the 2008 and 2009 corruption charge settlements, which we concluded with U.S. and German authorities, may endanger our business with government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations. Monitors could again be appointed to review future business practices and we may otherwise be required to further modify our business practices and our compliance program.

In its global business, Siemens does part of its business with state-owned enterprises and governments. We also participate in a number of projects funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations, such as multilateral development banks. Ongoing or potential future investigations into allegations of corruption, antitrust violations or other violations of law could as well impair relationships with such parties or could result in our exclusion from public contracts. Such investigations may also adversely affect existing private business relationships and our ability to pursue potentially important strategic projects and transactions, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures or other business alliances, or could result in the cancellation of certain of our existing contracts. Moreover, third parties, including our competitors, could initiate significant litigation.

In addition, future developments in ongoing and potential future investigations, such as responding to the requests of governmental authorities and cooperating with them, could divert management's attention and resources from other issues facing our business. Furthermore, we might be exposed to compliance risks in connection with recently acquired operations that are in the ongoing process of integration.

Along with other measures, Siemens has established a global compliance organization that conducts among others compliance risk mitigation processes such as Compliance Risk Assessments or initiates internal audit activities performed by the internal assurance department.

Changes of regulations, laws and policies: As a diversified company with global businesses we are exposed to various product- and country-related regulations, laws and policies influencing our business activities and processes. According to observations and analysis, there is an increasing risk that existing technical regulations in target markets will suddenly change, or new ones will be set in force, which result in market access criteria that our products do not meet. The affected products would lose marketability in this market. Reducing the risk of a sales-stop depends on the required correction for the non-conformity. In case the product can technically stay as is, while it has to undergo new and additional conformity assessment and certification, there will be considerable effort and cost to carry out the needed testing and certification procedures. In a worse case, the affected product will need re-engineering or re-design to meet the requirements of the changed or new technical regulation even before it can become re-assessed and certified for market approval. The latter case will cause significant extra effort and cost to make the needed product changes and to maintain the country-specific product variant as an additional derivative item in the portfolio. In the worst case, if the two aforementioned ways of maintaining the product's marketability prove to be not feasible, we must stop selling the affected product in the market. We monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all

<!-- PageNumber="28" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas, with the aim of quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed conditions. However, any changes in regulations, laws and policies could adversely affect our business activities and processes as well as our financial condition and results of operations.

Sanctions and export control: As a globally operating organization, we conduct business with customers in countries which are subject to export control regulations, embargoes, economic sanctions, debarment policies or other forms of trade restrictions (hereafter referred to as "sanctions") imposed by the U.S., the EU, China or other countries or organizations. New or expanded sanctions in countries in which we do business may result in a curtailment of our existing business in such countries or indirectly in other countries. We are also aware of policies of national authorities and institutional investors, such as pension funds or insurance companies, requiring divestment of interests in and prohibiting investment in and transactions with entities doing business with countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, it is possible that such policies may result in our inability to gain or retain certain investors or customers. In addition, the termination of our activities in sanctioned countries may expose us to customer claims and other actions. Our reputation could also suffer due to our activities with counterparties in or affiliated with these countries.

Protectionism (including tariffs/trade war): Protectionist trade policies, de-coupling and changes in the political and regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate, such as import and export controls, tariffs and other trade barriers including debarment from certain markets, and price or exchange controls, could affect our business in national markets and could impact our business situation, financial position and results of operations; we may also be exposed to penalties, other sanctions and reputational damage. In addition, the uncertainty of the legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights and subject us to increasing costs related to adjusting our compliance programs.

Environmental, health & safety and other governmental regulations: Some of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. Current and future environmental, health and safety and other governmental regulations or changes thereto may require us to change the way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operating or production costs. Furthermore, we see the risk of potential environmental and health and safety incidents as well as potential non-compliance with environmental and health and safety regulations affecting Siemens and our contractors or sub-suppliers, resulting for example in serious injuries, business interruptions, penalties, loss of reputation and internal or external investigations.

In addition, while we have procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable governmental regulations in the conduct of our business operations, it cannot be excluded that violations of applicable governmental regulations may be caused either by us or by third parties that we contract with, including suppliers or service providers whose activities may be attributed to us. Any such violations particularly expose us to the risk of liability, penalties, fines, reputational damage or loss of licenses or permits that are important to our business operations. In particular, we could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmental contamination at the facilities we design or operate. With regard to certain environmental risks, we maintain liability insurance at levels that our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. We may incur environmental losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance, and such losses may have an adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition and results of operations.

Current or future litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings: Siemens is and potentially will be involved in numerous legal disputes and proceedings in various jurisdictions. These legal disputes and proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates. Some of these legal disputes and proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens; or decisions, assessments or requirements of regulatory authorities could deviate from our expectations, which may have material effects on our business activities as well as our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Siemens maintains liability insurance for certain legal risks at levels our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. However, the insurance policy does not protect Siemens against, in particular, reputational damage. Moreover, Siemens may incur losses relating to legal disputes and proceedings beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance or exceeding any provisions made for losses related to legal disputes and proceedings. Finally, there can be no assurance that Siemens will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future.

For additional information with respect to specific proceedings, see Note 22 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.


### 8.3.5 Assessment of the overall risk situation

The most significant challenges have been mentioned first in each of the four risk categories: strategic, operational, financial and compliance.

While our assessments of individual risks have changed during fiscal 2022 due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, effects of our own mitigation measures and the revision of our risk assessment, the overall risk situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year. We currently see the strategic risk economic, political and geopolitical conditions as the most significant challenge for us followed by the operational risk cyber/information security.

At present, no risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going concern.


### 8.4 Opportunities

Within our ERM we regularly identify, evaluate and respond to opportunities that present themselves in our various fields of activity. Below we describe our most significant opportunities. Unless otherwise stated, the opportunities described relate to all organizational units. The order in which the opportunities are presented reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these opportunities and thus provides an indication of the opportunities' current importance to us. The described opportunities are not necessarily the only ones we encounter. In addition, our assessment of opportunities is subject to change because the Company, our markets and technologies are constantly advancing. It is also possible that opportunities we see today will never materialize.

Favorable political and regulatory environment (including sustainability): A favorable political and regulatory environment including the transition towards a low-carbon economy could restore a more positive industrial investment sentiment that supports the growth of

<!-- PageNumber="29" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

our markets. In addition, government initiatives and subsidies (including tax reforms, green and digital recovery plans, R&D among others) may lead to more government spending (e.g. infrastructure, healthcare, mobility or digitalization investments) and ultimately result in an opportunity for us to participate in ways that increase our revenue and profit. Investments to strengthen countries' resilience, energy and food security, as well as to diversify value chains close to major markets (reshoring, nearshoring) can present opportunities to businesses. By enabling our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using our portfolio and by reducing CO2 emission in our own operations, Siemens strives to support the transition towards a low-carbon economy. Siemens also welcomes and supports recent legislative and governmental measures to accelerate the mitigation of climate change, especially in Europe such as through the Green Deal or sustainable finance initiatives.

Turning COVID-19 challenges into opportunities: Accelerated post COVID-19 recovery of certain markets driven by e.g. digitalization, decarbonization and demographic change might lead to business opportunities. One of the success factors is a balanced and flexible workforce strategy. There is also the chance to strengthen our customer relationships through additional market offerings that specifically address use cases related directly to the COVID-19.

Value creation through innovation: We drive innovation by investing significantly in R&D in order to develop sustainable solutions for our customers while also strengthening our own competitiveness. Being an innovative company and constantly inventing new technologies that we expect will meet future demands arising from the megatrends of demographic change, urbanization, digitalization, environmental change, resource scarcity and glocalization is one of our core purposes. We are granted thousands of new patents every year and continuously develop new concepts and convincing new digital and data-driven business models. This helps us create the next generation of ground-breaking innovations in such fields as digital twin, artificial intelligence, automation and edge computing. Across our operating units, we are profiting from our strength in connecting the real and digital worlds. Our new Xcelerator platform is an open, digital business platform featuring a curated portfolio of IoT-enabled hardware and software, an ecosystem and a marketplace to enhance the digital transformation of our customers. We see growth opportunities in opening up access to new markets and customers through new marketing and sales strategies, which we implement in our operating units. Our position along the value chains of automation and digitalization allows us to further increase market penetration. Along these value chains, we have identified several clear growth fields in which we see our greatest long-term potential. Hence, we are combining and developing our resources and capabilities for these growth fields.

Mergers, acquisitions, equity investments, partnerships, divestments and streamlining our portfolio: We constantly monitor our current and potential markets to identify opportunities for strategic mergers, acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships, which may complement our organic growth. Such activities may help us to strengthen our position in our existing markets, provide access to new or underserved markets, or complement our technological portfolio in strategic areas. Opportunities might also arise when portfolio optimization measures generate gains, which enable us to further pursue our other strategies for growth and profitability.

Optimization of organization and processes: On the one hand, we leverage ideas to drive further improvements in our processes and cost structure, such as common computing architecture for image processing. Furthermore, we leverage ideas to drive further improvements in our processes and cost structure optimizing factory capacities for shorter lead times. On the other hand, we see an opportunity of further penetrating markets by quality initiative program and avoiding or reducing non conformance cost.

Leveraging Market Potential: Through sales and services initiatives we continuously strive to grow and extend our businesses in established markets, open up new markets for existing portfolio elements and strengthen our installed base in order to gain a higher market share and increased profits. Furthermore, we aim to increase our sales via improved account management and new distribution channels.

Assessment of the overall opportunities situation: The most significant opportunity for Siemens is favorable political and regulatory environment (including sustainability) as described above.

While our assessments of individual opportunities have changed during fiscal 2022 due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, our endeavors to profit from them and revision of our strategic plans, the overall opportunity situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year.


## 8.5 Significant characteristics of the internal control and risk management system


### 8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM

Our ICS and ERM are based on the principles, guidelines and measures introduced by the Managing Board, which are aimed at the organizational implementation of the Managing Board's decisions. Our ICS and ERM include the management of risks and opportunities relating to the achievement of business goals, the correctness and reliability of internal and external accounting, and compliance with the laws and regulations relevant to Siemens. Sustainability aspects are covered as well and are continuously developed based on the regulatory requirements.

Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally accepted COSO framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission). Our ERM approach is based on the COSO Standard "Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Performance" (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. Our ICS is based on the internationally recognized "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" (2013) also developed by COSO. The framework defines the elements of a control system and sets the standard for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our ICS, both systems are complementary.

All Siemens entities are part of our ICS and ERM. The scope of activities to be performed by each entity is different, depending, among others, on the entity's impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens and the specific risks associated with the entity. The management of each entity is obliged to implement an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within their area of responsibility, based on the group-wide mandatory methodology.

Overall responsibility for our ICS and ERM lies with the Managing Board. The Siemens Risk and Internal Control (RIC) organization bundles and integrates the internal control and ERM processes and supports the Managing Board in designing and maintaining adequate and

<!-- PageNumber="30" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

effective processes for implementing, monitoring and reporting on internal control and ERM activities. It consists of the central RIC departments of Siemens AG and the RIC departments at our organizational units. The central RIC departments are responsible for monitoring and coordinating the entire processes in order to ensure an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within the Group.

We have an overarching, integrated ICS and ERM methodology (RIC methodology) with a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested regularly for their adequacy and effectiveness. For more information on ERM, see chapter 8.2 Risk management.

Our ICS and ERM and their contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our internal audit function. These are carried out either as part of the risk-based annual audit plan or as part of audits scheduled during the year upon request. Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit function and annual audit plan. Topics from the annual audit plan of Siemens Healthineers that are also relevant for our Managing Board and Audit Committee must be mandated first by Siemens Healthineers' Managing Board and Audit Committee and subsequently by our Managing Board and Audit Committee. The audit procedures for these topics will be generally executed by joint teams including members of our and Siemens Healthineers' internal audit functions, thus respecting the interests of both Siemens AG and Siemens Healthineers.

At the end of each fiscal year, our Managing Board performs an evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS and ERM. This evaluation is based primarily on the Siemens "In Control"-Statement and quarterly Managing Board meetings. The purpose of the "In Control" Statement is to provide an overview of the key elements of the ICS and ERM of Siemens AG and its affiliated companies at the end of the fiscal year, to summarize the activities undertaken to review its adequacy and effectiveness and highlight any critical control weaknesses identified as part of these activities. The information contained in this statement is provided to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG to report on the effectiveness of the ICS and ERM. The Siemens "In Control" Statement is supported by certifications at various corporate levels and by all affiliated companies. In the quarterly Managing Board meetings, the company-wide risk and opportunity situation is evaluated, the results of the internal control process are explained and once a year an overall conclusion is made about the adequacy and effectiveness of our ICS or ERM. Based on this, the Managing Board has no indication that our ICS or ERM in their respective wholes have not been adequate or effective as of September 30, 2022.

Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any risk management and control system. For example, no system - even if deemed to be adequate and effective - can guarantee that all risks that will actually occur will be identified in advance or that any process violations will be ruled out under all circumstances.

The Audit Committee is systematically integrated into our ICS and ERM. In particular, it oversees the accounting and the accounting process as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS, ERM and the internal audit system.

Siemens Healthineers is largely subject to the Group-wide principles for our ICS and ERM and is responsible for adhering to those principles.

The integration of Varian into our ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, continued in fiscal 2022 and was completed to a large extent with regard to the most significant Varian entities. The integration measures will be continued in fiscal 2023.


### 8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)

The ICS and ERM also include a CMS geared to the Company's risk situation.

Our CMS is based on the three pillars -- prevent, detect and react -- and includes the legal risk areas of corruption, antitrust law, data protection, money laundering, export controls and respect for human rights. It is based on an extensive internal set of rules: The Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines ("BCG") define the basic principles and standards of behavior that must be observed by all employees in the company units and in relation to customers, external partners and the public. In addition, there are extensive internal compliance regulations, including associated controls, which oblige all Siemens employees to ensure the implementation of the CMS. They contain topic-specific implementation regulations for the individual risk areas with regard to compliance processes and tools as well as additional guidelines and information. The compliance operating model contains binding specifications for the employees of the compliance organization and describes responsibilities and how the CMS works.

Compliance risk management and compliance reviews as part of the CMS aim to identify compliance risks at an early stage and thus enable to take appropriate and effective measures to avoid or minimize risks. The risk assessment is also integrated into individual business processes and tools. The results of CMS that are relevant to the Group are taken into account as part of the Company-wide ERM.

The Compliance Control Program aims to ensure compliance and implementation of the CMS and processes used worldwide. It is part of the ICS and is continuously further developed and adapted to the current Siemens guidelines. In addition, current compliance issues are discussed at the management level on a regular basis.

The entire CMS is continuously adapted to business-specific risks and various local legal requirements. The findings from compliance risk management as well as compliance controls and audits are used to derive measures for its further development.


### 8.5.3 Significant characteristics of the accounting-related ICS and ERM

The overarching objective of our accounting-related ICS and ERM -- as part of the overarching ICS and ERM -- is to ensure that financial reporting is conducted in a proper manner, such that the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report of the Siemens Group and the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG as the parent company are prepared in accordance with all relevant regulations.

Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally recognized COSO framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission), for further information see 8.5.1.

At the end of each fiscal year, our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the accounting-related ICS. We have a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested regularly for their effectiveness. Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any control system, and no system, including one determined to be effective, may prevent or detect all misstatements

<!-- PageNumber="31" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the basis of a centrally issued conceptual framework which primarily consists of uniform Financial Reporting Guidelines and a chart of accounts. For Siemens AG and other companies within the Siemens Group required to prepare financial statements in accordance with German Commercial Code, this conceptual framework is complemented by mandatory regulations specific to the German Commercial Code. The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework due to regulatory changes is analyzed on an ongoing basis. Accounting departments are informed quarterly about current topics and deadlines from an accounting and closing process perspective.

The base data used in preparing our financial statements consists of the closing data reported by the operations of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries. The preparation of the closing data of most of our entities is supported by an internal shared services organization. Furthermore, other accounting activities, such as governance and monitoring activities, are usually bundled on a regional level. In particular cases, such as valuations relating to post-employment benefits, we use external experts. The reported closing data is used to prepare the financial statements in the consolidation system. The steps necessary to prepare the financial statements are subject to both manual and automated controls.

Qualification of employees involved in the accounting process is ensured through appropriate selection processes and training. As a fundamental principle, based on materiality considerations, the "four eyes" principle applies, and specific procedures must be adhered to for data authorization. Additional control mechanisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the composition of and changes in individual line items, both in the closing data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In line with our information security requirements, accounting-related IT systems contain defined access rules protecting them from unauthorized access. The manual and system-based control mechanisms referred to above generally also apply when reconciling the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) closing data to the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG.

On a quarterly basis, we execute an internal certification process. Management at different levels of our organization, supported by confirmations by managements of entities under their responsibility, confirms the accuracy of the financial data that has been reported to Siemens' corporate headquarters and reports on the effectiveness of the related control systems.

Siemens Healthineers is subject to our Group-wide principles for the accounting-related internal control and risk management system and is responsible for adhering to those principles.

The integration of Varian into our accounting-related ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, continued in fiscal 2022 and was largely completed with regard to the main Varian entities. The integration measures will be continued in fiscal 2023.

Our internal audit function systematically reviews our financial reporting integrity, our accounting-related ICS and ERM. Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit department and annual audit plan (see also 8.5.1). The Audit Committee is integrated into our accounting-related ICS. In particular, it oversees the accounting and accounting process and the adequacy and effectiveness of the associated ICS, the ERM and the internal audit system. Moreover, we have rules for accounting-related complaints.

## 9\. Siemens AG

The Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG have been prepared in accordance with the regulations set forth in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz).

In fiscal 2022, results for Siemens AG arise mainly from the business activities of Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure and are influenced significantly by the results of subsidiaries and investments we own either directly or indirectly. The business development of Siemens AG is fundamentally subject to the same risks and opportunities as the Siemens Group. Therefore, the foregoing explanations for the Siemens Group apply also for Siemens AG.

The Supervisory Board and the Managing Board propose to distribute a dividend of €4.25 per share of no par value entitled to the dividend, from the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 amounting to €3.613 million. The proposed dividend represents a total payout of €3.4 billion based on the estimated number of shares entitled to dividend at the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. We intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. This includes striving for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or that at least matches the prior-year level. For fiscal 2023, we expect that net income of Siemens AG will be sufficient to fund the distribution of a corresponding dividend.

As of September 30, 2022, the number of employees was around 49,000.

On a geographical basis, 74% of revenue was generated in the Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East region, 18% in the Asia, Australia region and 8% in the Americas region. Exports from Germany accounted for 57% of overall revenue. In fiscal 2022, orders for Siemens AG amounted to €20.8 billion.

The increases of revenue, cost of sales and research and development expenses were due mainly to Digital Industries.

The R&D intensity (R&D as a percentage of revenue) was 10%, on the same level as fiscal 2021. The research and development activities of Siemens AG are fundamentally the same as for its corresponding business activities within the Siemens Group. Research and development expenses in both periods related mainly to Digital Industries. On an average basis, Siemens AG employed 7,000 people in R&D in fiscal 2022.

The increase in selling and general administrative expenses was due mainly to higher selling expenses led also by Digital Industries.

Other operating income (expenses), net, included lower income from the release of provisions related to a former investment, as in fiscal 2021.

Financial income, net, was burdened by Siemens' decision to exit business activities in Russia as a consequence of the war in the Ukraine. Subsequent to this decision, Siemens AG recorded impacts of €0.6 billion in connection with allowances on receivables from affiliated companies and an impairment of €0.3 billion on the investment OOO Siemens, Russia. In addition to these impacts, financial income, net, decreased mainly due to the following reasons:

The main factors in lower income (loss) from investments, net included an increase of €3.4 billion in impairments on investments, driven by an impairment of €2.9 billion on Siemens AG's stake in Siemens Energy AG, Germany, and a decrease of €1.7 billion in gains from the disposals of investments, which in fiscal 2021 included a gain of €0.9 billion from the sale of Flender GmbH, Germany. These factors were partly offset by an increase of €2.9 billion in income from profit transfer agreements with affiliated companies, due mainly to higher income of €2.6 billion from Siemens Beteiligungen Inland GmbH, Germany, and an increase of €1.2 billion in income from investments, which included income of €2.4 billion from the investment in Siemens Beteiligungsverwaltung GmbH & Co. OHG, Germany.

A negative change in other financial income (expenses), net included a decrease of €0.7 billion in gains from non-current securities and a negative change of €0.6 billion for provisions relating to derivative financial instruments. Additionally, it included the allowances on receivables from affiliated companies of €0.6 billion as mentioned above. In contrast, there was a decrease of €0.6 billion in expenses from interest component of changes in pension provisions that are not offset against designated plan assets; this related mainly to a

<!-- PageNumber="33" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

decrease in performance of entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets and changes in the discount rates.

In connection with the decision to exit business activities in Russia following the war in Ukraine Net income was burdened by €0.8 billion.

| Deferred income | 235 | 249 | (5)% |
| Total liabilities and equity | 107,005 | 101,487 | 5% |

The main factor for the decrease in financial assets was the impairment on the stake in Siemens Energy AG.

The change in cash and cash equivalents, other securities related to the liquidity management of Corporate Treasury, which was focused not solely on the business activities of Siemens AG. The liquidity management is based on the financing policy of the Siemens Group, which is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Intra-group financing activities drove both an increase of €8.5 billion in receivables from affiliated companies, which resulted in higher inventories, receivables and other assets, and an increase of €5.0 billion in liabilities to affiliated companies, which was the main reason for the increase of trade payables, liabilities to affiliated companies and other liabilities.

The increase in provisions for pensions and similar commitments was due mainly to recording of current service and interest costs, including actuarial valuation effects relating to the increase of the rate of pension progression up to 2.0% per year (1.5% per year in fiscal 2021) in connection with the inflation, partly offset by payments for pensions and similar commitments.

The decrease in equity was due to dividends paid in fiscal 2022 (for fiscal 2021) of €3.2 billion and share buybacks during the year amounting to €1.6 billion. These factors were partly offset by net income for the year of €3.6 billion and the transfer of €0.6 billion in treasury shares to employees in connection with our share-based payment programs. The equity ratio as of September 30, 2022 decreased to 19%, from 21% a fiscal year earlier. For the disclosures in accordance with Section 160 para. 1 no. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act about treasury shares, refer to Note 15 of our Notes to Annual Financial Statements for fiscal 2022.

10\. Takeover-relevant information (pursuant to Sections 289a and 315a of the German Commercial Code) and explanatory report
===


## 10.1 Composition of common stock

As of September 30, 2022, the Company's common stock totaled €2.550 billion. The capital stock is divided into 850 million registered shares of no par value (Siemens shares). The shares are fully paid in. All shares confer the same rights and obligations. The shareholders' rights and obligations are governed in detail by the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, in particular by Sections 12, 53a et seq., 118 et seq. and 186 of the German Stock Corporation Act.


## 10.2 Restrictions on voting rights or transfer of shares

At the Shareholders' Meeting, each share of stock has one vote and accounts for the shareholder's proportionate share in the Company's net income. An exception to this rule applies with regard to treasury shares held by the Company, which do not entitle the Company to any rights. Under Section 136 of the German Stock Corporation Act the voting right of the affected shares is excluded by law.

Siemens shares issued to employees worldwide under the employee share programs implemented since the beginning of fiscal 2009, in particular the Share Matching Plan, are freely transferable unless applicable local laws provide otherwise. Under the rules of the Share Matching Plan, however, in order to receive one matching share free of charge for each three shares purchased, participants are required to hold the shares purchased by them for a vesting period of several years, during which the participants must be continuously employed by Siemens AG or any of its affiliated companies. The right to receive matching shares is forfeited if the purchased shares are sold, transferred, hedged on, pledged or hypothecated in any way during the relevant vesting period.

The von Siemens-Vermögensverwaltung GmbH (vSV) has, on a sustained basis, powers of attorney allowing it to exercise the voting rights for 10,584,465 shares (as of September 30, 2022) on behalf of members of the Siemens family. These shares are part of the total number of shares held by the family's members. The powers of attorney are based on an agreement between the vSV and, among others, members of the Siemens family. The shares are voted together by vSV, taking into account the suggestions of a family partnership established by the family's members or of one of this partnership's governing bodies.


## 10.3 Legislation and provisions of the Articles of Association applicable to the appointment and removal of members of the Managing Board and governing amendment to the Articles of Association

The appointment and removal of members of the Managing Board are subject to the provisions of Sections 84 and 85 of the German Stock Corporation Act and Section 31 of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz). According to Section 8 para. 1 of the Articles of Association, the Managing Board is comprised of several members, the number of which is determined by the Supervisory Board.

According to Section 179 of the German Stock Corporation Act, any amendment to the Articles of Association requires a resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting. The authority to adopt purely formal amendments to the Articles of Association was transferred to the Supervisory Board under Section 13 para. 2 of the Articles of Association. In addition, by resolutions adopted during past Shareholders' Meetings, the Supervisory Board has been authorized to amend Section 4 of the Articles of Association in accordance with the utilization of the Authorized and Conditional Capitals, and after expiration of the then-applicable authorization and utilization period.

Resolutions of the Shareholders' Meeting require a simple majority vote, unless a greater majority is required by law (Section 23 para. 2 of the Articles of Association). Pursuant to Section 179 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act, amendments to the Articles of Association require a majority of at least three-quarters of the capital stock represented at the time of the casting of the votes, unless another capital majority is prescribed by the Articles of Association.


### 10.4 Powers of the Managing Board to issue and repurchase shares

The Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until February 2, 2026 by up to €90 million through the issuance of up to 30 million Siemens shares against contributions in cash (Authorized Capital 2021). Subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded. The new shares shall be offered exclusively to employees of the Company and any of its affiliated companies. To the extent permitted by law, such employee shares may also be issued in such a manner that the contribution to be paid on such shares is covered by that part of the annual net income which the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board may allocate to other retained earnings under Section 58 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.

Furthermore, the Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until January 29, 2024 by up to €510 million through the issuance of up to 170 million Siemens shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind (Authorized Capital 2019).

As of September 30, 2022, the total unissued authorized capital of Siemens AG therefore consisted of €600 million nominal that may be used, in installments with varying terms, by issuance of up to 200 million Siemens shares.

By resolutions of the Shareholders' Meetings on January 30, 2019 and February 5, 2020, the Managing Board is authorized to issue bonds with conversion, exchange or option rights or with warrants attached, or a combination of these instruments, entitling the holders to subscribe to up to 80 million and up to 60 million Siemens shares, respectively. Based on these two authorizations, the Company or its affiliated companies may issue bonds until January 29, 2024 and February 4, 2025, respectively, each in an aggregate principal amount of up to €15 billion. In order to grant shares of stock to holders/creditors of such convertible bonds or warrant bonds, the capital stock was conditionally increased by resolutions of the Shareholders' Meetings in 2019 and 2020, by up to 80 million and up to 60 million Siemens

<!-- PageNumber="35" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

shares, respectively (Conditional Capitals 2019 and 2020), i.e. in total by up to €420 million through the issuance of up to 140 million Siemens shares.

The new shares under Authorized Capital 2019 and the aforementioned bonds are to be issued against cash or non-cash contributions. They are, as a matter of principle, to be offered to shareholders for subscription. The Managing Board is authorized to exclude, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, subscription rights of shareholders in the event of capital increases against contributions in kind. In the event of capital increases against contributions in cash, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude shareholders' subscription rights with the approval of the Supervisory Board in the following cases:

. The issue price of the new shares/bonds is not significantly lower than the stock market price of the Siemens shares already listed or the theoretical market price of the bonds computed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial methods (exclusion of subscription rights, limited to 10% of the capital stock, in accordance with or by mutatis mutandis application of Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 German Stock Corporation Act).

. The exclusion is necessary with regard to fractional amounts resulting from the subscription ratio.

· The exclusion is used to grant holders of conversion or option rights or conversion or option obligations on Siemens shares a compensation for the effects of dilution.

The new shares issued or to be issued in exchange for contributions in cash and in kind and with shareholders' subscription rights excluded, may in certain cases be subject to further restrictions. The details of those restrictions are described in the relevant authorization. In addition, the Managing Board has issued the commitment not to increase the capital stock from the Authorized Capital 2019 and the Conditional Capitals 2019 and 2020 by a total of more than 10% of the capital stock existing at the time of the Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020, to the extent that capital increases with shareholders' subscription rights excluded are made from the Authorized Capital 2019 against contributions in cash or in kind or to service convertible bonds and/or warrant bonds issued under the authorizations approved on January 30, 2019 or February 5, 2020 with shareholders' subscription rights excluded. This commitment ends no later than February 4, 2025.

The Company may not repurchase its own shares unless so authorized by a resolution duly adopted by the shareholders at a general meeting or in other very limited circumstances set forth in the German Stock Corporation Act. On February 5, 2020, the Shareholders' Meeting authorized the Company to acquire until February 4, 2025 up to 10% of its capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution or - if this value is lower - as of the date on which the authorization is exercised. The aggregate of shares of stock of Siemens AG repurchased under this authorization and any other Siemens shares previously acquired and still held in treasury by the Company or attributable to the Company pursuant to Sections 71d and 71e of the German Stock Corporation Act may at no time exceed 10% of the then existing capital stock. Any repurchase of Siemens shares shall be accomplished at the discretion of the Managing Board either (1) by acquisition over the stock exchange, (2) through a public share repurchase offer or (3) through a public offer to swap Siemens shares for shares in a listed company within the meaning of Section 3 para. 2 German Stock Corporation Act. The Managing Board is additionally authorized to complete the repurchase of Siemens shares in accordance with the authorization described above by using certain derivatives (put and call options, forward purchases and any combination of these derivatives). In exercising this authorization, all stock repurchases based on the derivatives are limited to a maximum volume of 5% of Siemens' capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution at the Shareholders' Meeting. A derivative's term of maturity may not, in any case, exceed 18 months and must be chosen in such a way that the repurchase of Siemens shares upon exercise of the derivative will take place no later than February 4, 2025.

In addition to selling them over the stock exchange or through a public sales offer to all shareholders, the Managing Board is authorized by resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020 to also use Siemens shares repurchased on the basis of this or any previously given authorization for every permissible purpose, in particular as follows: Such Siemens shares may be

· retired;

· used in connection with share-based compensation programs and/or employee share programs of the Company or any of its affiliated companies and issued to individuals currently or formerly employed by the Company or any of its affiliated companies as well as to board members of any of the Company's affiliated companies;

. offered and transferred, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to third parties against non-cash contributions;

. sold by the Managing Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, against payment in cash if the price at which such Siemens shares are sold is not significantly lower than the market price of Siemens stock (exclusion of subscription rights, limited to 10% of the capital stock, by mutatis mutandis application of Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 German Stock Corporation Act); or

. used to service or secure obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares arising particularly from or in connection with convertible bonds or warrant bonds of the Company or its affiliated companies. Moreover, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude subscription rights in order to grant holders/creditors of conversion or option rights or respective conversion or option obligations on Siemens shares subscription rights as compensation against effects of dilution to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercise of such rights or fulfillment of such obligations, and to use Siemens shares to service such subscription rights.

Furthermore, the Supervisory Board is authorized to use shares acquired on the basis of this or any previously given authorization to meet obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares that were or will be agreed with members of the Managing Board within the framework of rules governing Managing Board compensation.

On June 24, 2021, the Company announced that it would launch a new five-year share buyback program, beginning in fiscal 2022. This buyback, which began on November 15, 2021 and extends at the latest until September 15, 2026, is limited to a maximum value of €3 billion (excluding incidental transaction charges) on purchases of no more than 50 million Siemens shares. Using the authorization given by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020, Siemens repurchased 14.2 million shares by September 30, 2022 under this share buyback. This buyback has the exclusive purposes of retirement, of issuing shares to employees, board members of affiliated companies and members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, and of servicing/securing the obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares arising particularly from or in connection with convertible bonds and warrant bonds.

As of September 30, 2022, the Company held 57,454,171 shares of stock in treasury.

<!-- PageHeader="Combined Management Report" -->

For details on the authorizations referred to above, especially the terms to exclude subscription rights, please refer to the relevant resolution and to Section 4 of the Articles of Association.

10.5 Significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid

As of September 30, 2022, Siemens AG maintained lines of credit in the amount of €7.45 billion.

In December 2021, Siemens AG entered into two bilateral loan agreements in the total amount of €600 million, which have been fully drawn.

In December 2021, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement in the amount of €500 million, which has been fully drawn. In addition, in March 2020 and in June 2019 respectively, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement, each of which has been drawn in the full amount of US$ 500 million.

The lines of credit, and the relevant loan agreements mentioned above provide their respective lenders with a right of termination in the event that (1) Siemens AG becomes a subsidiary of another company or (2) a person or a group of persons acting in concert acquires effective control over Siemens AG by being able to exercise decisive influence over its activities (Art. 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004).

Framework agreements concluded by Siemens AG under International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. documentation (ISDA Agreements) grant each counterparty a right of termination, including in certain cases of (i) a transformation (for example mergers and changes of form), (ii) an asset transfer or (iii) acquisition of ownership interests that enables the acquirer to exercise control over Siemens AG or its controlling bodies. Partially this right of termination exists only, if (1) the resulting entity fails to simultaneously assume Siemens AG's obligations under the ISDA Agreements or (2) the resulting entity's creditworthiness is materially weaker than Siemens AG's immediately prior to such event. Generally, ISDA Agreements are designed such that upon termination all outstanding payment claims documented under them are to be netted.


## 10.6 Compensation agreements with members of the Managing Board or employees in the event of a takeover bid

The contracts with the members of the Managing Board previously contained the right of the member to terminate his or her contract with the Company for good cause in the event of a change of control that results in a substantial change in the position of a Managing Board member (for example, due to a change in corporate strategy or a change in the Managing Board member's duties and responsibilities). A change of control exists if one or several shareholders acting jointly or in concert acquire a majority of the voting rights in Siemens AG and exercise a controlling influence, or if Siemens AG becomes a dependent enterprise as a result of entering into an intercompany agreement within the meaning of Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act, or if Siemens AG is to be merged into an existing corporation or other entity. If this right of termination is exercised, the Managing Board member is entitled to a severance payment in the amount of no more than two years' compensation. The calculation of the annual compensation includes not only the base compensation and the target amount for the bonus, but also the target amount for the stock awards, in each case based on the most recent completed fiscal year prior to termination of the contract. The stock-based compensation components for which a firm commitment already exists will remain unaffected. Additionally, the severance payments cover non-monetary benefits by including an amount of 5% of the total severance amount. Severance payments will be reduced by 10% as a lump-sum allowance for discounted values and for income earned elsewhere. However, this reduction will apply only to the portion of the severance payment that was calculated without taking account of the first six months of the remaining term of the Managing Board member's contract. There is no entitlement to a severance payment if the Managing Board member receives benefits from third parties in connection with a change of control. A right to terminate the contract does not exist if the change of control occurs within a period of twelve months prior to a Managing Board member's retirement.

On September 18, 2019, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG resolved that the contracts with members of the Managing Board should not contain such right of termination in the future. This has already been taken into account in the case of contract extensions and in the case of new contracts with the newly appointed members of the Managing Board as of October 1, 2020.


## 10.7 Other takeover-relevant information

We are not aware of, nor have we during the last fiscal year been notified of, any shareholder directly or indirectly holding 10% or more of the voting rights. There are no Siemens shares with special rights conferring powers of control. Shares of stock issued by Siemens AG to employees under its employee share program and/or as share-based compensation are transferred to the employees. The beneficiary employees who hold shares of employee stock may exercise their control rights in the same way as any other shareholder in accordance with applicable laws and the Articles of Association.

6\. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
===


## NOTE 1 Basis of presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements present the operations of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft with registered offices in Berlin (registry number HRB 12300) and Munich (registry number HRB 6684), Germany, and its subsidiaries (the Company or Siemens). They have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union as well as with the additional requirements set forth in Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The Consolidated Financial Statements are in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Consolidated Financial Statements were authorized for issue by the Managing Board on December 5, 2022. Siemens prepares and reports its Consolidated Financial Statements in euros (€). Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided. Siemens is a German based multinational focused technology company.


### NOTE 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates

Certain of the following accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where Siemens reasonably could have used a different estimate in the current accounting period. Siemens cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require adjustment.

Overall, we face an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, including potential energy and gas shortfalls or outages, less predictable and escalating volatility in non-financial and financial markets (in share prices, rising interest and inflation rates, foreign currency prices, etc.), as well as a rising apprehension of a potential shift into an economic downturn. Impacts of the pandemic coronavirus spread on Siemens' Consolidated Financial Statements are contingent on the further evolution of virus variants and its dangerousness, the progress of worldwide vaccinations, the vaccines' effectiveness and the imposition of consequential lockdowns. Effects vary considerably by region and customer industries. Siemens is currently operating in a surrounding, which requires dealing with COVID-19, the war in Ukraine and sanctions imposed on Russia as well as the need to take potential countermeasures being taken by Russia into account. Uncertainties increase in prognosis and forecasts, in applying critical accounting estimates and in using management judgements. Those trends could impact fair values and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, amount and timing of results of operations and cash flows of Siemens. Severity and duration of those trends are decisive on the magnitude of its impact on Siemens' Consolidated Financial Statements. Siemens based its estimates and assumptions on existing knowledge and best information available.

Following the war in Ukraine, Siemens decided to exit business activities in Russia. Subsequent to this decision, Income from continuing operations was burdened by negative effects totaling €1.3 billion related to these activities primarily at Mobility, SFS and Corporate Treasury of Financing, eliminations and other items. For further information, see Notes 3, 4, 11, 13, 23 and 29.

Basis of consolidation - The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries over which the Company has control. Siemens controls an investee if it has power over the investee. In addition, Siemens is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from the involvement with the investee and Siemens is able to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of Siemens' return.

Business combinations - Cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination (including contingent liabilities) are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method). If there is no loss of control, transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions not affecting net income. At the date control is lost, any retained equity interests are remeasured to fair value. In case of a written put option on non-controlling interests the Company assesses whether the prerequisites for the transfer of present ownership interest are fulfilled at the balance sheet date. If the Company is not the beneficial owner of the shares underlying the put option, the exercise of the put option will be assumed at each balance sheet date and treated as equity transaction between shareholders with the recognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise price. The non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the reporting period.

Associates and joint ventures - Associates are companies over which Siemens has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally through direct or indirect ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting rights). Joint ventures are entities over which Siemens and one or more parties have joint control. Joint control requires unanimous consent of the parties sharing control in decision making on relevant activities.

Associates and joint ventures are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. If the investment was retained in a transaction in which Siemens lost control of a subsidiary, the fair value of the investment represents the cost on initial recognition. Siemens' share of its associate's or joint venture's post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and its share of post-acquisition changes in equity that have not been recognized in the associate's or joint venture's profit or loss is recognized directly in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition changes also include effects from fair value adjustments and are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When Siemens' share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the investment, Siemens does not recognize further losses, unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. The interest in an associate or joint venture is the carrying amount of the investment together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of Siemens' net investment in the associate or joint venture.

Siemens reviews associates and joint ventures for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that its investment is impaired, for example a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. This includes the use of judgements, in particular with respect to the net investment in Siemens Energy AG.

<!-- PageHeader="Consolidated Financial Statements" -->

Foreign currency translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is other than the euro, are translated using the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while the Consolidated Statements of Income are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Differences arising from such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign subsidiary is recognized. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.

Foreign currency transaction - Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at that functional currency applying the spot exchange rate at the date when the underlying transactions are initially recognized. At the end of the reporting period, foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are revalued to functional currency applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized in net income. Those foreign currency-denominated transactions which are classified as non-monetary are remeasured using the historical spot exchange rate.

Revenue recognition - Siemens recognizes revenue when, or as control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer; i.e. when the customer is able to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits, provided a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is probable taking our customer's creditworthiness into account. Revenue is the transaction price Siemens expects to be entitled to. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. The amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better predict the amount of variable consideration. Consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing benefit either to the customer or Siemens. If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices. If stand-alone selling prices are not observable, the Company reasonably estimates those. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in time or over time.

Revenues from construction-type contracts: Revenues are recognized over time under the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs. An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense immediately. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.

The percentage-of-completion method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. These significant estimates include total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical, political and regulatory risks, risks from supply chain constraints and other judgments. Under the percentage-of-completion method, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. In addition, Siemens needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it is terminated. In determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to be the most likely scenario, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on an individual basis.

Revenues from maintenance and service contracts: Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than straight-line, as services are provided, i.e. under the percentage-of-completion method as described above. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.

Revenues from product sales: Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods. Invoices are issued at that point in time and are usually payable within 30 days.

Revenues from software contracts: Software contracts usually comprise the sale of subscription licenses and perpetual licenses, which are both on-premise, as well as technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades and the sale of software-as-a- service. Subscription contracts generally contain two separate performance obligations: time-based software license and technical support service. Revenues for perpetual and time-based licenses granting the customer a right to use Siemens' intellectual property are recognized at a point in time, i.e. when control of the license passes to the customer. Revenues for technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades are recognized over time on a straight-line basis as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by Siemens' services. Software-as-a-service contracts including related cloud services represent one performance obligation for which revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis. Payment terms for all transactions are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.

Income from interest - Interest is recognized using the effective interest method.

Functional costs - In general, operating expenses by types are assigned to the functions following the functional area of the corresponding profit and cost centers. Amortization, depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are included in functional costs depending on the use of the assets.

Product-related expenses - Provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties are recorded in line item Cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized.

Research and development costs - Costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in IAS 38 are met. Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses with an amortization period of generally three to 25 years.

Earnings per share - Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income from continuing operations, income from discontinued operations and net income, all attributable to ordinary shareholders of Siemens AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by assuming conversion or exercise of all potentially dilutive securities and share- based payment plans.

Goodwill - Goodwill is not amortized, instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit or a group of cash- generating units, generally represented by a segment. Siemens Healthineers is tested one level below the segment. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

<!-- PageNumber="8" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Consolidated Financial Statements" -->

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the (group of) cash-generating unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. If the carrying amount of the (group of) cash-generating unit(s), to which the goodwill is allocated, exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to that (group of) cash-generating unit(s) is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the (group of) cash-generating unit(s)' fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both values. These values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.

The determination of the recoverable amount of a (group of) cash-generating unit(s) to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management. The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g. by the successful integration of acquired entities, volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the outlook on economic trends. In determining recoverable amounts, discounted cash flow calculations generally use five-year projections (in exceptional cases up to ten years) that are based on financial forecasts. Cash flow projections consider past experience and represent management's best estimate about future developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. These estimates, including the methodology used, can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.

Other intangible assets - The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives for patents, licenses and other similar rights generally range from three to five years, except for intangible assets with finite useful lives acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks as well as technology. Useful lives in specific acquisitions ranged from two to 30 years for customer relationships and trademarks (in fiscal 2021 four to 30 years) and for technology from five to 22 years (in fiscal 2021 five to 22 years).

Property, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment, is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method. The following useful lives are assumed:

|||
| - | - |
| Factory and office buildings | 20 to 50 years |
| Other buildings | 5 to 10 years |
| Technical machinery & equipment | generally 10 years |
| Office & other equipment | generally 5 years |
| Equipment leased to others | generally 3 to 7 years |

Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets - The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of estimates in determining the assets' recoverable amount, which can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment.

Leases - A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Further information on leases can be found in Notes 8, 13 and 16.

Lessor: Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases, determined based on whether substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are transferred. If this is the case, the lease is classified as a finance lease; if not, it is an operating lease. Receivables from finance leases are recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The assets underlying the operating leases are presented in Property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives or to their estimated residual value. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Lessee: Siemens recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months if the underlying asset is not of low value. Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation expense and impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurements. Right-of-use assets are depreciated under the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying assets. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term, generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured in case of modifications or reassessments of the lease.

Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for disposal - Discontinued operations are reported when a component of an entity is classified as held for disposal or has been disposed of, if the component represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to disposal. A non-current asset or a disposal group is held for disposal if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction or through a distribution to owners rather than through continuing use. Depreciation and amortization cease for assets classified as held for disposal. In the Consolidated Statements of Income and of Cash Flows, discontinued operations are reported separately from continuing operations; prior periods are presented on a comparable basis. The disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements outside of Note 3 relate to continuing operations or assets and liabilities not held for disposal. The determination of the fair value less costs to sell includes the use of estimates and assumptions that tend to be uncertain.

Income taxes - Tax positions are calculated taking into consideration the respective local tax laws, relevant court decisions and applicable tax authorities' views. Tax regulations can be complex and possibly subject to different interpretations of tax payers and local tax authorities. Different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislative procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into account based on management's considerations. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected tax consequences of future periods attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available, including income from forecasted operating earnings, the reversal of existing taxable temporary

<!-- PageNumber="9" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Consolidated Financial Statements" -->

differences and available tax planning opportunities that Siemens would execute. As of each period-end, Siemens evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets, based on taxable income of past periods and projected future taxable profits. As future developments are uncertain and partly beyond Siemens's control, assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets will recover. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption.

Contract assets, contract liabilities, receivables - When either party to a contract with customers has performed, Siemens presents a contract asset, a contract liability or a receivable depending on the relationship between Siemens' performance and the customer's payment. Contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in the normal operating cycle. Receivables are recognized when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivables in accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets measured at amortized cost.

Inventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production costs and net realizable value, costs being generally determined based on an average or first-in, first-out method. Determining net realizable value of inventories involves accounting estimates for quantity, technical and price risks.

Defined benefit plans - Siemens measures the entitlements by applying the projected unit credit method. The approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)), the expected rates of future salary increases and expected rates of future pension progressions are considered. The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of the period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year. Significant plans apply individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interest expense. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the preceding fiscal year's period-end date.

Service cost, past service cost and settlement gains (losses) for pensions and similar obligations as well as administration costs unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs. Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized immediately in profit or loss. For unfunded plans, the amount in line item Provisions for pensions and similar obligations equals the DBO. For funded plans, Siemens offsets the fair value of the plan assets from the DBO. Siemens recognizes the net amount, after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling.

Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset). They are recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.

Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases, rate of pension progression and mortality rates. Discount rates used are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period. In case such yields are not available, discount rates are based on government bonds yields. Due to changing market, economic and social conditions, the underlying key assumptions may differ from actual developments.

Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at period-end. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the DBO is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value.

Provisions - A provision is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position when it is probable that the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. When a contract becomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision.

Significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to onerous contracts, warranty costs, asset retirement obligations, legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations (Legal Proceedings). Siemens records a provision for onerous contracts with customers when current estimates of total estimated costs exceed estimated revenue. Onerous contracts with customers are identified by monitoring the progress of the project and updating the estimates which requires significant judgment relating to achieving certain performance standards as well as estimates involving warranty costs and estimates regarding project delays including the assessment of responsibility splits between the contract partners for these delays.

Legal Proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, considerable judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is a present obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the reporting period, whether it is probable that such a Legal Proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Internal and external counsels are generally part of the determination process. Due to new developments, it may be necessary, to record a provision for an ongoing Legal Proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision. Upon resolution of a Legal Proceeding, Siemens may incur charges in excess of the recorded provisions for such matters. The outcome of Legal Proceedings may have a material effect on Siemens' financial position, its results of operations and/or its cash flows.

Termination benefits - Termination benefits are provided as a result of an entity's offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy before the regular retirement date or from an entity's decision to terminate the employment. Termination benefits in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.

Financial instruments - A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model they are held in, financial instruments are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost, measured at fair value, loan commitments, contract assets and receivables from finance leases. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date. Initially, financial instruments are recognized at fair value and net of transaction costs, if not categorized at FVTPL. Subsequently, financial assets and liabilities are measured according to the category to which they are assigned to:

Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL): a) mandatorily measured at FVTPL: Debt financial assets are measured at FVTPL if the business model they are held in is not a hold-to-collect or a hold-and-sell business model, or if their contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI-option is elected. b) Financial assets designated as measured at FVTPL are irrevocably designated at initial recognition if the designation

<!-- PageNumber="10" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Consolidated Financial Statements" -->

significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise if assets and liabilities as well as recognizing gains (losses) were measured on different bases.

Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): are equity instruments for which Siemens irrevocably elects to present subsequent fair value changes in OCI at initial recognition of the instrument. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income tax expenses, as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the instruments are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.

Financial assets measured at amortized cost: Loans, receivables and other debt instruments held in a hold-to-collect business model with contractual cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less valuation allowances for expected credit losses.

Valuation allowances are set up for expected credit losses, representing a forward-looking estimate of future credit losses involving significant judgment. Expected credit loss is the gross carrying amount less collateral, multiplied by the probability of default and a factor reflecting the loss in the event of default. Valuation allowances are not recognized when the gross carrying amount is sufficiently collateralized. Probabilities of default are mainly derived from internal rating grades. A simplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease receivables and contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses. The valuation allowance for loans and other long-term debt instruments primarily held at Financial Services (SFS) is measured according to a three-stage impairment approach:

Stage 1: At inception, twelve-month expected credit losses are recognized based on a twelve months probability of default.

Stage 2: If the credit risk of a financial asset increases significantly without being credit-impaired, lifetime expected credit losses are recognized based on a lifetime probability of default. A significant increase in credit risk is determined for each individual financial instrument using internal credit ratings. A rating deterioration does not trigger a transfer into Stage 2, if the credit rating remains within the investment grade range. More than 30 days past due payments will not be transferred into Stage 2, if the delay is not credit-risk- related.

Stage 3: If the financial asset is credit-impaired, valuation allowances equal lifetime expected credit losses. A financial asset is considered credit-impaired when there is observable information about significant financial difficulties and a high vulnerability to default, however, the definition of default is not yet met. Impairment triggers include liquidity problems, a request for debt restructuring or a breach of contract. A credit-risk driven contractual modification always results in a credit-impaired financial asset.

Financial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely. Generally, if the limitation period expired, when a debtor's sworn statement of affairs is received, or when the receivable is not pursued due to its minor value. Receivables are written off when bankruptcy proceedings close.

A financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party. Significant modifications of contractual terms of a financial asset measured at amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new financial asset; for insignificant modifications, the carrying amount of the financial asset is adjusted without derecognition.

Cash and cash equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.

Loan Commitments - Expected credit losses for irrevocable loan commitments are determined using the three-stage impairment approach for financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized as a liability.

Financial liabilities - except for derivative financial instruments, Siemens measures financial liabilities at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Derivative financial instruments - Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value unless they are designated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or, in the case of a cash flow hedge, in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes (applicable deferred income tax). Certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted for separately as derivatives.

Fair value hedges: The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk. Where an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in its fair value is recognized as a separate financial asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income. For hedged items carried at amortized cost, the adjustment is amortized until maturity of the hedged item. For hedged firm commitments the initial carrying amount of the assets or liabilities that result from meeting the firm commitments are adjusted to include the cumulative changes in the fair value that were previously recognized as separate financial assets or liabilities.

Cash flow hedges: The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.

Share-based payment - Share-based payment awards at Siemens are predominately designed as equity-settled. Fair value is measured at grant date and is expensed over the vesting period. Fair value is determined as the market price of the underlying shares, considering dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to as well as market conditions and non-vesting conditions, if applicable. Plans granting the rights to receive subsidiary shares constitute own shares and, accordingly, are accounted as equity-settled.

Prior-year information - The presentation of certain prior-year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

NOTE 3 Acquisitions and dispositions
===


## Acquisitions

The purchase price allocation of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (Varian) was finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to reflect new information obtained. Adjustments were made retrospectively as of the acquisition date and increased Goodwill by €0.2 billion to €8.2 billion and decreased Other intangible assets by €0.1 billion to €6.2 billion. The adjustments were due to valuation effects resulting from the final allocation of intangible assets, including goodwill, to currency areas and new information in the context of Varian's project business. Due to the allocation to individual currency areas, the foreign currency translation led to a decrease in Other components of equity of €0.3 billion as of September 30, 2021.

In October 2021, Siemens acquired all shares in the Netherlands based company SQCAP B.V. (Sqills), a provider in the provision of cloud- based inventory management, reservation, and ticketing software to public transport operators around the world. The acquired business is integrated into Mobility. The purchase price is €537 million paid in cash, plus a contingent consideration recognized at the acquisition date at an amount of €88 million, representing the upper end of the bandwidth. The purchase price allocation was finalized as of fiscal year-end. Resulting Other Intangible assets include mainly customer-related intangible assets of €200 million and technology-related intangible assets of €138 million. Goodwill of €365 million comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know- how and expected synergy effects. The acquired business is included since the beginning of the reporting period and contributed Revenue of €32 million and Net income of €(26) million for the period from its acquisition date to September 30, 2022, including earnings effects from the purchase price allocation and integration costs.

In August 2022, Siemens acquired all shares in Brightly Software Inc. (Brightly), an U.S .- based software-as-a-service (Saas) provider of asset and maintenance management solutions. The acquired business will be integrated into Smart Infrastructure. The purchase price is U$1.166 billion (€1.144 billion) paid in cash plus a contingent consideration recognized at the acquisition date at US$135 million (€132 million) which is based on the achievement of revenue related performance indicators as of September 30, 2024, and September 2025. The outcome of the contingent consideration is estimated to range between zero and US$0.3 billion (€0.3 billion). The purchase price allocation is preliminary as a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities has not been finalized; it resulted in the following assets and liabilities: Goodwill of €1.1 billion, customer-related intangible assets of €0.6 billion, other intangible assets of €0.1 billion, other assets of €0.1 billion, long-term debt of €0.4 billion (settled after the acquisition), a deferred tax liability of €0.2 billion and other liabilities of €0.1 billion. Goodwill comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how and expected synergy effects. The acquired business contributed Revenue of €25 million and a Net loss of €8 million for the period from its acquisition date to September 30, 2022, including earnings effects from the purchase price allocation and integration costs. If Brightly had been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 1, 2021, revenue and net income, including earnings effects from purchase price allocation and integration costs, would have been €72.103 billion and €4.318 billion, respectively, in fiscal year 2022.

In addition, Siemens closed several smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2022 and 2021 for a total purchase price of €123 million and €429 million, respectively, mainly paid in cash. In fiscal 2022, and 2021, the (preliminary) purchase price allocations resulted in Other intangible assets of €54 million and €147 million, respectively, and Goodwill of €81 million and €254 million, respectively, which comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how and expected synergy effects. The purchase price allocation for some of the acquired businesses is preliminary, as a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities has not been finalized.


## Disposals

In January 2022, Siemens signed an agreement to sell its intelligent road traffic solutions business Yunex Traffic (Yunex) to Atlantia S.p.A. The transaction closed as of June 30, 2022. The consideration received was €930 million in cash. Siemens recorded a pre-tax gain on the disposal of €738 million, which is presented in other operating income. The business was previously reported at Mobility.

In February 2022, Siemens signed an agreement to sell the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics GmbH (Parcel Logistics) to the Körber Group. The transaction closed as of July 1, 2022. The consideration received was €1,136 million, mainly in cash.

Mobility holds a 50% investment in a joint venture accounted for using the equity method, which wholly owns an operating company in Russia that designs and manufactures commuter trains and electric locomotives. Significant changes with an adverse effect in the economic and legal environment subsequent to sanctions imposed on Russia triggered an impairment of €172 million presented in Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net, resulting in a recoverable and carrying amount of nil.

In February 2022, Siemens AG and Valeo GmbH signed an agreement to sell Siemens AG's 50% stake in the at equity accounted joint venture Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH (disclosed in Portfolio Companies) to Valeo GmbH. The transaction closed in July 2022. The agreement triggered a partial reversal of a previous impairment and resulted in a gain of €292 million presented in Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net. The recoverable amount was derived from the net consideration (including repayment of shareholder loans).

Siemens Energy AG, an associate accounted for using the equity method, is globally active in the transmission and generation of electrical power and is publicly listed. The stock market value of the investment in Siemens Energy AG was €2.9 billion and € 5.9 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, Siemens Energy AG added a loss to Share of profit (loss), net of €(207) million and €(396) million, respectively. The loss includes Siemens' share of Siemens Energy AG's net losses of €(142) million and €(159) million as well as effects from fair value adjustments at initial recognition of €(65) million and €(237) million, respectively. In fiscal 2022, our investment in Siemens Energy AG was impaired by €2.7 billion. The impairment loss is included in Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method and in reconciling items of Segment information. As of June 30, 2022, the significant decline in the fair value of the investment triggered an impairment test. At this date, the recoverable amount of €3.6 billion was determined as the investment's fair value less costs to sell using Siemens Energy AG's market capitalization (level 1 of the fair value hierarchy). Siemens received dividends of 26 million from Siemens Energy AG in fiscal 2022.

Below summarized financial information of Siemens Energy AG are disclosed at a 100 per cent basis. They are adjusted to align with Siemens' accounting policies and to incorporate effects from fair value adjustments at initial recognition.

## NOTE 7 Income taxes Income tax expenses (benefits) consist of the following:

| (in millions of €) | Fiscal year ||
|| 2022 | 2021 |

| Current taxes | 3,163 | 1,650 |
| Deferred taxes | (422) | 211 |
| Income tax expenses | 2,741 | 1,861 |

Current income tax expenses in fiscal 2022 and 2021 include adjustments recognized for current taxes of prior years in the amount of €220 million and €(359) million, respectively. The deferred tax expenses (benefits) in fiscal 2022 and 2021 include tax effects of the origination and reversal of temporary differences of €(430) million and €94million, respectively, and contain deferred tax benefit of €(202) million and €(16) million, respectively, caused by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences.

In Germany, the calculation of current taxes is based on a combined tax rate of 31%, consisting of a corporate tax rate of 15%, a solidarity surcharge thereon of 5.5% and an average trade tax rate of 15%. For foreign subsidiaries, current taxes are calculated based on the local tax law and applicable tax rates in the individual foreign countries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities in Germany and abroad are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled.

Current and deferred income tax expenses differ from the amounts computed by applying a combined statutory German income tax rate of 31% as follows:

| (in millions of €) | Fiscal year ||

Siemens performs the mandatory annual impairment test in the three months ended September 30. Key assumptions on which Siemens based its determinations of the fair value less costs to sell for the (group of) cash-generating unit(s) include terminal value growth rates

<!-- PageNumber="17" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Consolidated Financial Statements" -->

up to 1.9% and 1.7% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively and after-tax discount rates of 6.5% to 12.0% in fiscal 2022 and 5.5% to 12.0% in fiscal 2021.

To estimate the fair value less costs to sell of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units, cash flows were projected for the next five years (in exceptional cases up to ten years) based on past experience, actual operating results and management's best estimate about future developments as well as market assumptions. The determined fair value of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units is assigned to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value less costs to sell is mainly driven by the terminal value, which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions on the terminal value growth rate and discount rate. Both assumptions are determined individually for each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Siemens Financial Services' discount rate represents its specific cost of equity. The discount rates are calculated based on a risk-free rate of interest and a market risk premium. In addition, the discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit or group of cash- generating units by taking into account specific peer group information on beta factors, leverage and cost of debt as well as country specific premiums. The parameters for calculating the discount rates are based on external sources of information. The peer group is subject to an annual review and adjusted, if necessary. Terminal value growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data and industry specific trends.

The following table presents key assumptions used to determine fair value less costs to sell for impairment test purposes for the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated:

| (in millions of €) | Goodwill | Sep 30, 2022 Terminal value growth rate | After-tax discount rate |
| - | - | - | - |
| Digital Industries | 8,226 | 1.9% | 9.0% |
| Varian of Siemens Healthineers | 8,134 | 1.9% | 8.0% |
| Imaging of Siemens Healthineers | 7,260 | 1.9% | 7.5% |

Revenue figures in the detailed forecast planning period of the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated are based on average revenue growth rates (excluding portfolio effects) of between 8.3% and 10.3% (7.3% and 9.3% in fiscal 2021).

| (in millions of €) | Goodwill | Sep 30, 2021 Terminal value growth rate | After-tax discount rate |
| - | - | - | - |
| Varian of Siemens Healthineers | 7,636 | 1.7% | 7.8% |
| Digital Industries | 7,417 | 1.7% | 8.5% |
| Imaging of Siemens Healthineers | 6,525 | 1.7% | 7.5% |

The sensitivity analysis for the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated was based on a reduction in after-tax future cash flows by 10% or an increase in after-tax discount rates by one percentage point or a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by one percentage point. Siemens concluded that no impairment loss would need to be recognized on goodwill in any of these groups of cash-generating units.

## NOTE 17 Post-employment benefits


### Defined benefit plans

The defined benefit plans open to new entrants are based predominantly on contributions made by the Company. Only to a certain extent, those plans are affected by longevity, inflation and compensation increases and take country specific differences into account. The Company's major plans are funded with assets in segregated entities. In accordance with local laws these plans are managed in the interest of the beneficiaries by way of contractual trust agreements with each separate legal entity. The defined benefit plans cover 443,000 participants, including 180,000 actives, 84,000 deferreds with vested benefits and 179,000 retirees and surviving dependents.


## Germany

In Germany, pension benefits are provided through the following plans: BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans as well as deferred compensation plans. The majority of active employees participate in the BSAV. Those benefits are based predominantly on notional contributions and the return on the corresponding assets of this plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the employer. At inception of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases. However, the frozen plans still expose Siemens to investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk. The pension plans are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). In Germany no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply.


### U.S.

In the U.S., the Pension Plans are sponsored by Siemens, which for the most part have been frozen to new entrants and to future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. Siemens has appointed the Investment Committee as the named fiduciary for the management of the assets of the Plans. The Plans' assets are held in Trusts and the trustees of the Trusts are responsible for the administration of the assets of the Trusts, taking directions from the Investment Committee. The Plans are subject to the funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA). There is a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum funding level of 80% in the defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions. At their discretion, sponsoring employers may contribute in excess of this regulatory requirement. Annual contributions are calculated by independent actuaries.


### U.K.

Pension benefits are mainly offered through the Siemens Benefit Scheme for which, until the start of retirement, an inflation increase of the majority of accrued benefits is mandatory. The required funding is determined by a funding valuation carried out every third year based on legal requirements. Due to deviating guidelines for the determination of the discount rates, the technical funding deficit is usually larger than the IFRS funding deficit. To reduce the deficit Siemens entered into an agreement with the trustees to provide annual payments of £31 (€36) million until fiscal 2033. The agreement also provides for a cumulative advance payment by Siemens AG compensating the remaining annual payments at the date of early termination of the agreement due to cancellation or insolvency.

#### Switzerland

Following the Swiss law of occupational benefits (BVG) each employer has to grant post-employment benefits for qualifying employees. Accordingly, Siemens in Switzerland sponsors several cash balance plans. These plans are administered by external foundations. The board of the main foundation is composed of equally many employer and employee representatives. The board of the foundation is responsible for investment policy and asset management, as well as for any changes in the plan rules and the determination of contributions to finance the benefits. The Company is required to make total contributions at least as high as the sum of the employee contributions set out in the plan rules. In case of an underfunded plan the Company together with the employees may be asked to pay supplementary contributions according to a well-defined framework of recovery measures.

1 Discloses previous year figures including Flender. Accordingly, it comprises the total of continuing and discontinued operations.

2 Total Defined benefit obligation (DBO) includes other post-employment benefits of €299 million and €345 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively, which primarily consist of transition payments to German employees after retirement as well as post-employment health care and life insurance benefits to employees in the U.S. and India.

3 Includes past service benefits/costs, settlement gains/losses and administration costs related to liabilities.

Net interest expenses relating to provisions for pensions and similar obligations amount to €51 million and €53 million, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021. The DBO is attributable to actives 29% and 29%, to deferreds with vested benefits 13% and 15% and to retirees and surviving dependents 58% and 57%, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021.

The DBO remeasurements comprise actuarial (gains) and losses resulting from:

<!-- PageNumber="23" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Consolidated Financial Statements" -->


##### Actuarial assumptions

The weighted-average discount rate used for the actuarial valuation of the DBO was as follows:

| | Sep 30, ||
|| 2022 | 2021 |
| - | - | - |
| Discount rate | 3.9% | 1.3% |
| EUR | 3.7% | 0.9% |
| USD | 5.5% | 2.8% |
| GBP | 4.8% | 1.9% |
| CHF | 2.2% | 0.3% |

The discount rate was derived from high-quality corporate bonds with an issuing volume of more than 100 million units in the respective currency zones, which have been awarded an AA rating (or equivalent) by at least one of the three rating agencies Moody's Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings or Fitch Ratings.

Applied mortality tables are:

| Germany | Siemens specific tables (Siemens Bio 2017/2022) |
| - | - |
| U.S. | Pri-2012 with generational projection from the US Social Security Administration's Long Range Demographic Assumptions |
| U.K. | SAPS S3 (Standard mortality tables for Self Administered Pension Schemes with allowance for future mortality improvements) |
| CH | BVG 2020 G with generational projection according to CMI model with a long-term trend rate of 1.25% |

The mortality tables used in Germany (Siemens Bio 2017/2022) are mainly derived from data of the German Siemens population and to a lesser extent from data of the Federal Statistical Office in Germany by applying formulas in accordance with recognized actuarial standards.

The rates of compensation increase and pension progression for countries with significant effects are shown in the following table. Inflation effects, if applicable, are included in the assumptions below.

| | Sep 30, ||
|| 2022 | 2021 |
| - | - | - |
| Compensation increase | | |
| U.K. | 3.3% | 3.0% |
| CH | 1.5% | 1.4% |
| Pension progression | | |
| Germany | 2.0% | 1.5% |
| U.K. | 3.2% | 3.1% |


##### Sensitivity analysis

A one-half-percentage-point change of the above assumptions would result in the following increase (decrease) of the DBO:

| Effect on DBO due to a one-half percentage-point increase decrease increase decrease |||||
| (in millions of €) | Sep 30, ||||
|| 2022 || 2021 ||
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Discount rate | (1,328) | 1,450 | (2,045) | 2,259 |
| Rate of compensation increase | 77 | (74) | 95 | (89) |
| Rate of pension progression | 973 | (813) | 1,559 | (1,386) |

The DBO effect of a 10% reduction in mortality rates for all beneficiaries would be an increase of €800 million and €1,196 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.

As in prior years, sensitivity determinations apply the same methodology as applied for the determination of the post-employment benefit obligation. Sensitivities reflect changes in the DBO solely for the assumption changed.


###### Asset Liability Matching Strategies

As a significant risk, the Company considers a decline in the plans' funded status due to adverse developments of plan assets and/or defined benefit obligations resulting from changing parameters. Accordingly, Siemens implemented a risk management concept aligned with the defined benefit obligations (Asset Liability Matching). Risk management is based on a worldwide defined risk threshold (Value at Risk). The concept, the Value at Risk and the asset development including the investment strategy are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis under consultation of senior external experts. Independent asset managers are selected based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, which include their performance and risk evaluation. Derivatives are used to reduce risks as part of risk management.

Virtually all equity securities have quoted prices in active markets. The fair value of fixed income securities is based on prices provided by price service agencies. The fixed income securities are traded in active markets and almost all fixed income securities are investment grade. Alternative investments include hedge funds, private equity and real estate investments, thereof real estate used by the Company with a fair value of €734 million and €530 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. Multi strategy funds mainly comprise absolute return funds and diversified growth funds that invest in various asset classes within a single fund and aim to stabilize return and reduce volatility. Derivatives predominantly consist of financial instruments for hedging interest rate risk and inflation risk.


####### Future cash flows

Employer contributions expected to be paid to defined benefit plans in fiscal 2023 are €250 million. Over the next ten fiscal years, average annual benefit payments of €1,869 million and €1,754 million, respectively, are expected as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. The weighted average duration of the DBO for Siemens defined benefit plans was 10 and 12 years, respectively, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.


## Defined contribution plans and state plans

Amounts recognized as expenses for defined contribution plans are €611 million and €484 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contributions to state plans amount to €1,630 million and €1,449 million, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021.

The majority of the Company's provisions are generally expected to result in cash outflows during the next five years.

Warranties mainly relate to products sold. Order related losses and risks are provided for anticipated losses and risks on uncompleted construction, sales and leasing contracts.

The Company is subject to asset retirement obligations related to certain items of property, plant and equipment. Such asset retirement obligations are primarily attributable to environmental clean-up costs and to costs primarily associated with the removal of leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term.

Environmental clean-up costs relate to remediation and environmental protection liabilities which have been accrued based on the estimated costs of decommissioning the site for the production of uranium and mixed-oxide fuel elements in Hanau, Germany (Hanau facilities), as well as for a nuclear research and service center in Karlstein, Germany (Karlstein facilities). In May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a contract under public-law, based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of €360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to measure the obligations that remain with Siemens AG, regarding conditioning and packaging of nuclear waste, as well as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility "Schacht Konrad" or a logistics depot until year-end 2032. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the provisions total €487 million and €507 million, respectively.

Other includes provisions for life and industrial business reinsurance contracts (liability, property, construction) in connection with the Siemens Energy business of €339 million and €487 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021; thereof life €159 million and €248 million and industrial business €180 million and €239 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. The provisions are for incurred and reported insurance losses as well as for incurred, hence, not yet reported insurance losses as of fiscal year-end. The provision is determined using actuarial standard valuation methodologies, which are parameterized based on historical loss data. Life reinsurance contracts have an average term of 19 years, whereas the cash outflows for the industrial business reinsurance contracts are expected within the next five years. Other also includes provisions for Legal Proceedings, as far as the risks that are subject to such Legal Proceedings are not already covered by project accounting. Provisions for Legal Proceedings amounted to €236 million and €251 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, €181 million and €109 million are included for claims and charges resulting from the construction business. Furthermore, Other includes provision for indemnifications in connection with dispositions of businesses of €92 million and €96 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. Such indemnifications may protect the buyer from potential tax, legal and other risks in conjunction with the purchased business.


### NOTE 19 Equity

Siemens' issued capital is divided into 850 million registered shares with no par value and a notional value of €3.00 per share as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The shares are paid in full. At the Shareholders' Meeting, each share has one vote and accounts for the shareholders' proportionate share in the Company's net income. All shares confer the same rights and obligations.

In fiscal 2022 and 2021, Siemens repurchased 14,185,791 shares and 976,346 shares, respectively. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, Siemens transferred 4,376,201 and 4,022,053 treasury shares, respectively.

#### NOTE 20 Additional capital disclosures

A key consideration of our capital structure management is to maintain ready access to capital markets through various debt instruments and to sustain our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. In order to achieve our target, Siemens intends to maintain an Industrial net debt divided by EBITDA (continuing operations) ratio of up to 1.5 for fiscal 2022 and beyond in accordance with our Financial Framework and a ratio of up to 1.0 as of September 2021 and prior periods. The ratio indicates the approximate number of years that would be needed to cover the Industrial net debt through Income from continuing operations, excluding interest, other financial income (expenses), taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairments. The fiscal 2021 ratio is disclosed as computed in the prior year.

1 Debt is generally reported at a value approximately representing the amount to be repaid. Accordingly, debt in a hedging relationship is adjusted for fair values of interest hedges as well as for foreign currency hedge effects. Siemens deducts resulting changes in fair value, to derive an amount of debt that approximates the amount that will be repaid.

2 The adjustment considers that both Moody's and S&P view Siemens Financial Services as a captive finance company. These rating agencies generally recognize and accept higher levels of debt attributable to captive finance subsidiaries in determining credit ratings. Following this concept, Siemens excludes Siemens Financial Services debt.

The SFS business is capital intensive and operates with a larger amount of debt to finance its operations compared to the industrial business.

## NOTE 21 Commitments and contingencies

The following table presents the undiscounted amount of maximum potential future payments for major groups of guarantees:

| (in millions of €) | Sep 30, 2022 | Sep 30, 2021 |
| - | - | - |
| Credit guarantees | 515 | 530 |
| Performance guarantees | 9,309 | 15,116 |
| | 9,824 | 15,646 |

Credit guarantees cover the financial obligations of third parties generally in cases where Siemens is the vendor and (or) contractual partner or Siemens is liable for obligations of associated companies accounted for using the equity method. Additionally, credit guarantees are issued in the course of the SFS business. Credit guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or non-payment by the primary debtor, Siemens will be required to settle such financial obligations. The maximum amount of these guarantees is equal to the outstanding balance of the credit or, in case a credit line is subject to variable utilization, the nominal amount of the credit line. These guarantees have typically residual terms of up to four years. The Company held collateral mainly through inventories and trade receivables. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, Credit guarantees include €123 million and €124 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy. Siemens accrued €2 million and €3 million relating to credit guarantees as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Furthermore, Siemens issues performance guarantees, which mainly include performance bonds. In the event of non-fulfillment of contractual obligations by the primary obligor, Siemens will be required to pay up to an agreed-upon maximum amount. These agreements typically have terms of up to ten years. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, Performance guarantees include €8,562 million and €14,508 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy; the related contract liability amount for parent company

<!-- PageHeader="Consolidated Financial Statements" -->

guarantees is generally reduced using the straight-line method over the planned term of the underlying delivery or service agreement. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company accrued €54 million and €51 million, respectively, relating to performance guarantees.

As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, in addition to guarantees disclosed in the table above, there are contingent liabilities of €421 million and €475 million which mainly result from other guarantees, legal proceedings and from joint and several liabilities of consortia, in particular from the construction of a power plant in Finland. Other guarantees include €99 million and €189 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.

NOTE 2 Legal proceedings


### Proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations

As previously reported, in July 2008, Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. (OTE) filed a lawsuit against Siemens AG with the district court of Munich, Germany, seeking to compel Siemens AG to disclose the outcome of its internal investigations with respect to OTE. OTE seeks to obtain information with respect to allegations of undue influence and/or acts of bribery in connection with contracts concluded between Siemens AG and OTE from calendar 1992 to 2006. At the end of July 2010, OTE expanded its claim and requested payment of damages by Siemens AG of at least €57 million to OTE for alleged bribery payments to OTE employees. In October 2014, OTE increased its damage claim to the amount of at least €68 million. Siemens AG continues to defend itself against the expanded claim.

As previously reported, in May 2014, the Public Affairs Office (Ministério Público) São Paulo initiated a lawsuit against Siemens Ltda. as well as other companies and several individuals claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL2.5 billion (approximately €476 million as of September 2022) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train refurbishment contracts entered into between 2008 and 2011. In January 2015, the district court of Sao Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the State of São Paulo and two customers against Siemens Ltda., Siemens AG and other companies and individuals claiming damages in an unspecified amount. In March 2015, the district court of São Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Ministério Público) São Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and other companies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL487 million (approximately €93 million as of September 2022) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts entered into in 2000 and 2002. In September 2015, the district court of São Paulo admitted another lawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Ministerio Público) São Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and other companies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL918 million (approximately €175 million as of September 2022) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts entered into in 2006 and 2007. Siemens is defending itself against these actions. It cannot be excluded that further significant damage claims will be brought by customers or the state against Siemens.

As previously reported, in June 2015, Siemens Ltda. appealed to the Supreme Court against a decision of a previous court to suspend Siemens Ltda. from participating in public tenders and signing contracts with public administrations in Brazil for a five year term based on alleged irregularities in calendar 1999 and 2004 in public tenders with the Brazilian Postal authority. In June 2018, the court accepted Siemens' appeal and declared the earlier instance decision as void. In June 2021, the court referred the case back to the court of first instance. In February 2018, the Ministério Público in Brasilia filed a lawsuit based on the same set of facts, mainly claiming the exclusion of Siemens Ltda. from public tenders for a ten year term. Siemens Ltda. is defending itself against the lawsuit. Siemens Ltda. is currently not excluded from participating in public tenders.

Siemens is involved in numerous Legal Proceedings in various jurisdictions. These Legal Proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be extended. Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates.

Some of these Legal Proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens, which may have material effects on its business activities as well as its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

For Legal Proceedings information required under IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is not disclosed if the Company concludes that disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the matter.

Cash and cash equivalents include €164 million and €190 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are not available for use by Siemens mainly due to minimum reserve requirements with banks. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the carrying amount of financial assets Siemens pledged as collateral is €166 million and €156 million, respectively.

The following table presents the fair values and carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost for which the carrying amounts do not approximate fair value:

Fixed-rate and variable-rate receivables with a remaining term of more than twelve months, including receivables from finance leases, are evaluated by the Company based on parameters such as interest rates, specific country risk factors, individual creditworthiness of the customer, and the risk characteristics of the financed project. Based on this evaluation, allowances for these receivables are recognized.

The fair value of notes and bonds is based on prices provided by price service agencies at the period-end date (Level 2). The fair value of loans from banks and other financial indebtedness as well as other non-current financial liabilities are estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities (Level 2).

The following table allocates financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value to the three levels of the fair value hierarchy:

Fair value of equity instruments quoted in an active market is based on price quotations at period-end date. Fair value of debt instruments, is either based on prices provided by price service agencies or is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates.

Fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined in accordance with the specific type of instrument. Fair values of derivative interest rate contracts are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument. Interest rate futures are valued based on quoted market prices, if available. Fair values of foreign currency derivatives are based on forward exchange rates. Options are generally valued based on quoted market prices or based on option pricing models. No compensating effects from underlying transactions (e.g. firm commitments and forecast transactions) are considered.

The Company limits default risks resulting from derivative financial instruments by generally transacting with financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of investment grade. Based on Siemens' net risk exposure towards the counterparty, the resulting credit risk is considered via a credit valuation adjustment.

As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, Level 3 financial assets include venture capital investments of €607 million and €515 million (Next47 investments). In fiscal 2022 and 2021, new level 3 investments and purchases amounted to €221 million and €522 million, respectively. Sales of Level 3 financial assets amounted to €100 million and €305 million, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021.

## NOTE 24 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities

To hedge foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks, derivatives are contracted to achieve a 1:1 hedge ratio so that the main characteristics match the underlying hedged items (e.g. nominal amount, maturity) in a critical term match, which ensures an economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items suitable for hedge accounting. The nominal amounts of hedging instruments by maturity are:

| (in millions of €) | Sep 30, 2022 || Sep 30, 2021 ||
|| Up to 12 months | More than 12 months | Up to 12 months | More than 12 months |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Foreign currency exchange contracts | 5,872 | 16,751 | 3,605 | 14,676 |
| Interest rate swaps | 763 | 11,210 | 873 | 5,752 |
| therein: included in cash flow hedges | 205 | − | 13 | 605 |
| therein: included in fair value hedges | 558 | 11,210 | 859 | 5,147 |

Fair values of each type of derivative financial instruments reported as financial assets or financial liabilities in line items Other current financial assets (liabilities) or Other financial assets (liabilities) are:

| (in millions of €) | Sep 30, 2022 || Sep 30, 2021 ||
|| Asset | Liability | Asset | Liability |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Foreign currency exchange contracts | 3,086 | 722 | 893 | 569 |
| therein: included in cash flow hedges | 2,648 | 319 | 544 | 231 |

| Other (embedded derivatives, options, commodity swaps) | 95 | 89 | 70 | 45 |
| | 3,825 | 1,900 | 1,950 | 769 |

Other components of equity, net of income taxes, relating to cash flow hedges reconciles as follows:

| (in millions of €) | Interest rate risk | Foreign currency risk ||
|| Cash flow hedge reserve | Cash flow hedge reserve | Cost of hedging reserve |
| - | - | - | - |
| Balance as of October 1, 2021 | (17) | (28) | 95 |
| Hedging gains (losses) presented in OCI | 81 | (307) | (198) |
| Reclassification to net income | (11) | 165 | (110) |
| Balance as of September 30, 2022 | 53 | (170) | (213) |
| thereof: discontinued hedge accounting | (7) | (39) | − |

Amounts reclassified to net income in connection with interest rate risk hedges and non-operative foreign currency hedges are presented in Other financial income (expenses), net. Reclassifications of foreign currency risk hedges with operative business purposes are presented as functional costs. Costs of hedging reserve is the forward element of forward contracts that are not designated as hedge accounting and which are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis as the hedged item is time-period related.


## Foreign currency exchange rate risk management


### Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship

The Company manages its risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, debt, firm commitments and forecast transactions primarily through a Company-wide portfolio approach. Under this approach the Company-wide risks are aggregated centrally, and various derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and options, are utilized to minimize such risks. Such a strategy does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The Company also accounts for foreign currency derivatives, which are embedded in sale and purchase contracts.


#### Cash flow hedges

The Company's operating units apply hedge accounting to certain significant forecast transactions and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Particularly, the Company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of variability of future cash flows resulting from forecast sales and purchases as well as firm commitments. The risk mainly results from contracts denominated in US$ both from Siemens' operating units entering into long-term contracts e.g. from the project business and from the standard product business. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, the risk is hedged against the euro at an average rate of 1.2293 €/US$ and 1.2808 €/US$ (forward purchases of US$), respectively and 1.0258 €/US$ and 1.2070 €/US$ (forward sales of US$). As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the hedging transactions have an average remaining maturity until 2027 and 2026 (forward purchases of US$) as well as 2023 and 2022 (forward sales of US$).

<!-- PageNumber="32" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Consolidated Financial Statements" -->

Included are Siemens' foreign currency forward contracts, entered into in fiscal 2021, to hedge foreign currency risks relating to US$10 billion (€10 billion) bonds granted to Siemens Healthineers, through which a synthetic Euro financing structure is achieved. It factually, also turns interest into € with volume weighted average interest rates of currently about 0.3% and 0.3%, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021.


## Interest rate risk management


### Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship

Interest rate risk management relating to the Group, excluding SFS' businesses, uses derivative financial instruments under a portfolio- based approach to manage interest risk actively. Interest rate management of the SFS and businesses remains to be managed separately, considering the term structure of SFS' financial assets and liabilities on a portfolio basis. Neither approach qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. Net cash receipts and payments in connection with interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expense in Other financial income (expenses), net.


### Cash flow hedges of floating-rate commercial papers

Siemens applies cash flow hedge accounting to a revolving portfolio of floating-rate commercial papers of nominal US$200 million. Siemens pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate of interest, offsetting future changes in interest payments of the underlying floating-rate commercial papers. Net cash receipts and payments are recorded as interest expenses. The Company had interest rate swap contracts to receive variable rates of interest of an average of 3.64% and 0.13%, respectively, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and paid fixed rates of interest at an average rate of 1.95% and 1.95%, respectively, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.


#### Fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt obligations

Under interest rate swap agreements outstanding in fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company agreed to pay a variable rate of interest multiplied by a notional principal amount, and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest multiplied by the same notional principal amount. These interest rate swap agreements offset future changes in interest rates designated as hedged risk on the fair value of the underlying fixed-rate debt obligations. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the carrying amounts of €10,718 million and €6,305 million, respectively, of fixed-rate debt obligations are designated in fair value hedges, including €(973) million and €304 million cumulative fair value hedge adjustments. Unamortized fair value hedge adjustments of €169 million and €181 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, relate to no longer applied hedge accounting. The amounts are amortized over the remaining term of the underlying debt, maturing until 2042. Carrying amount adjustments to debt of €1,273 million and €236 million, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021 are included in Other financial income (expenses), net; the related swap agreements resulted in gains (losses) of €(1,236) million and €(243) million, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Net cash receipts and payments relating to such interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expenses.

The Company had interest rate swap contracts to pay variable rates of interest of an average of 0.86% and (0.14)% as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively and received fixed rates of interest (average rate of 1.07% and 1.50%, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively). The notional amount of indebtedness hedged as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was €11,719 million and €6,007 million, respectively. This changed 26% and 15% of the Company's underlying notes and bonds from fixed interest rates into variable interest rates as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The notional amounts of these contracts mature at varying dates based on the maturity of the underlying hedged items. The net fair value of interest rate swap contracts (excluding accrued interest) used to hedge indebtedness as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was €(959) million and €277 million, respectively.


### NOTE 25 Financial risk management

Increasing market fluctuations may result in significant earnings and cash flow volatility risk for Siemens. The Company's operating business as well as its investment and financing activities are affected particularly by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. In order to optimize the allocation of financial resources across Siemens' segments and entities, as well as to achieve its aims, Siemens identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks. The Company seeks to manage and control these risks primarily through its regular operating and financing activities and uses derivative financial instruments when deemed appropriate.

In order to quantify market risks Siemens has implemented a system based on Value at Risk (VaR), which is also used for internal management of Corporate Treasury activities. The VaR figures are calculated based on historical volatilities and correlations of various risk factors, a ten day holding period, and a 99.5% confidence level.

Actual results that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income may differ substantially from VaR figures due to fundamental conceptual differences. While the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are prepared in accordance with IFRS, the VaR figures are the output of a model with a purely financial perspective and represent the potential financial loss, which will not be exceeded within ten days with a probability of 99.5%. Although VaR is an important tool for measuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some limitations including the following. A ten day holding period assumes that it is possible to dispose of the underlying positions within this period. This may not be valid during continuing periods of illiquid markets. A 99.5% confidence level means that there is a 0.5% statistical probability that losses could exceed the calculated VaR. The use of historical data as a basis for estimating the statistic behavior of the relevant markets and finally determining the possible range of the future outcomes on the basis of this statistic behavior may not always cover all possible scenarios, especially those of an exceptional nature.

Any market sensitive instruments, including equity and interest-bearing investments that our Company's pension plans hold are not included in the following quantitative and qualitative disclosures.

## Foreign currency exchange rate risk


### Transaction risk

Each Siemens unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to future cash flows denominated in a currency other than its functional currency is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the ordinary course of business, Siemens units are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective currencies as well as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets.

Operating units are prohibited from borrowing or investing in foreign currencies on a speculative basis. Intercompany financing or investments of operating units are preferably carried out in their functional currency or on a hedged basis.

According to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. Foreign currency transaction exposure of Siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is generally hedged approximately by 100% with Corporate Treasury. Foreign currency transaction exposure of Siemens units from planned business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with Corporate Treasury within a band of 75% to 100% for a hedging period of at least three months.

Generally, the operating units conclude their hedging activities internally with Corporate Treasury. By applying a cost-optimizing portfolio approach, Corporate Treasury itself hedges foreign currency exchange rate risks with external counterparties and limits them.

As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the VaR relating to foreign currency exchange rates was €126 million and €39 million. This VaR was calculated under consideration of items of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in addition to firm commitments, which are denominated in foreign currencies, as well as foreign currency denominated cash flows from forecast transactions for the following twelve months. The increase in the VaR resulted mainly from a higher net foreign currency position after hedging activities and a higher volatility, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro.


#### Translation risk

Many Siemens units are located outside the Eurozone. Because the financial reporting currency of Siemens is the euro, the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into euro for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. To consider the effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is that investments in foreign-based operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous. Effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amounts into euro are reflected in the Company's consolidated equity position.


## Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different. In order to manage the Company's position with regard to interest rate risk, interest income and interest expenses, Corporate Treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest rate risk management by using fixed or variable interest rates from bond issuances and derivative financial instruments when appropriate. The interest rate risk relating to the Group, excluding SFS' business, is mitigated by managing interest rate risk within an integrated Asset Liability Management approach. The interest rate risk relating to SFS' business is managed separately, considering the term structure of financial assets and liabilities. The Company's interest rate risk results primarily from funding in the U.S. dollar, British pound and euro.

If there are no conflicting country-specific regulations, all Siemens operating units generally obtain any required financing through Corporate Treasury in the form of loans or intercompany clearing accounts. The same concept is adopted for deposits of cash generated by the units.

As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the VaR relating to the interest rate was €864 million and €529 million. The increase was driven mainly by a higher interest rate volatility for the U.S. dollar and the euro.


### Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk results from the Company's inability to meet its financial liabilities. Siemens follows a deliberated financing policy that is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Siemens mitigates liquidity risk by the implementation of effective working capital and cash management, arranged credit facilities with highly rated financial institutions, via a debt issuance program and via a global multi-currency commercial paper program. Liquidity risk may also be mitigated by the Siemens Bank GmbH, which increases the flexibility of depositing cash or refinancing.

In addition, Siemens constantly monitors funding options available in the capital markets, as well as trends in the availability and costs of such funding, with a view to maintaining financial flexibility and limiting repayment risks.

The following table reflects our contractually fixed pay-offs for settlement, repayments and interest. The disclosed expected undiscounted net cash outflows from derivative financial liabilities are determined based on each particular settlement date of an instrument and based on the earliest date on which Siemens could be required to pay. Cash outflows for financial liabilities (including interest) without fixed amount or timing are based on the conditions existing at September 30, 2022.

1 Based on the maximum amounts Siemens could be required to settle in the event of default by the primary debtor.

2 A considerable portion result from asset-based lending transactions meaning that the respective loans can only be drawn after sufficient collateral has been provided by the borrower.


## Credit risk

Credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in financial instruments if the contractual partner is failing to discharge its obligations in full and on time or if the value of collateral declines.

Siemens provides its customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing particularly in connection with large projects. Hence, credit risks are determined by the solvency of the debtors, the recoverability of the collaterals, the success of projects we invested in and the global economic development.

The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a core competency of our risk management system. In this context, Siemens has implemented a binding credit policy.

Siemens maintains a Credit Risk Intelligence Unit to which numerous operating units from the Siemens Group regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized internal rating and credit limit recommendation process. Due to the identification, quantification and active management of credit risks, this increases credit risk transparency.

Ratings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating methodologies, with information obtained from customers, external rating agencies, data service providers and Siemens' credit default experiences. Internal ratings consider appropriate forward-looking information relevant to the specific financial instrument like expected changes in the debtor's financial position, ownership, management or operational risks, as well as broader forward-looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industry- related and competitive developments. The ratings also consider a country-specific risk component derived from external country credit ratings. Ratings and credit limits for financial institutions as well as Siemens' public and private customers, which are determined by internal risk assessment specialists, are continuously updated and considered for investments in cash and cash equivalents and in determining the conditions under which direct or indirect financing will be offered to customers.

An exposure is considered defaulted if the debtor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit obligations. A range of internally defined events trigger a default rating, including the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, receivables being more than 90 days past due, or a default rating by an external rating agency.

To analyze and monitor credit risks, the Company applies various systems and processes. A main element is a central IT application that processes data from operating units together with rating and default information and calculates an estimate, which may be used as a basis for individual bad debt provisions. Additionally, qualitative information is considered to particularly incorporate the latest developments.

The carrying amount is the maximum exposure to a financial asset's credit risk, without taking account of any collateral. Collateral reduces the valuation allowance to the extent it mitigates credit risk. Collateral needs to be specific, identifiable and legally enforceable to be taken into account. Those collaterals are mostly held in the portfolio of SFS.

As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, collateral of €1,444 million and €748 million, respectively, relate to financial assets measured at fair value. Those collaterals are provided in connection with netting agreements for derivatives providing protection from the risk of a counterparty's insolvency. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, collateral held for credit-impaired receivables from finance leases amounted to €53 million and €90 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, collateral held for financial assets measured at amortized cost amounted to €3,817 million and €3,328 million, respectively, including €108 million and €46 million, respectively, for credit-impaired loans in SFS' asset finance business. Those collaterals mainly comprised property, plant and equipment. Credit risks arising from irrevocable loan commitments are equal to the expected future pay-offs resulting from these commitments.

SFS' external financing portfolio disaggregates into credit risk rating grades as of September 30, 2022 as follows (pre valuation allowances):

| (in millions of €) | Loans and other debt instruments under the general approach ||| Financial guarantees and loan commitments ||| Lease Re- ceivables |
|| Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 ||
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Investment Grade Ratings | 6,134 | 4 | n/a | 729 | n/a | n/a | 2,257 |
| Non-Investment Grade Ratings | 16,382 | 702 | 640 | 3,182 | 56 | 53 | 3,678 |

<!-- PageNumber="35" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Consolidated Financial Statements" -->

Trade receivables of operating units are generally rated internally; as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, approximately 45% and 47%, respectively, have an investment grade rating and 55% and 53%, respectively, have a non-investment grade rating. Contract assets generally show similar risk characteristics as trade receivables in operating units.

Amounts above do not represent economic credit risk, since they consider neither collateral held nor valuation allowances already recognized.


### Equity Price Risk

Siemens' investment portfolio consists of direct and indirect investments in publicly traded companies that are classified as long term investments. These investments are monitored based on their current market value, affected primarily by fluctuations on the volatile technology-related markets worldwide. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the market value of Siemens' portfolio, which mainly consists of one investment in a publicly traded company, was €339 million and €678 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the VaR relating to the equity price was €74 million and €105 million.


#### NOTE 26 Share-based payment

Share-based payment awards may be settled in newly issued shares of capital stock of Siemens AG, in treasury shares or in cash. Share- based payment awards may forfeit if the employment of the beneficiary terminates prior to the expiration of the vesting period. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, expense from equity-settled awards on a continuing basis are €377 million and €294 million; cash-settled awards on a continuing basis resulted in gains (expenses) of €12 million and €(8) million in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Included is expense of €160 million and €137 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting from various individually immaterial plans, of which €110 million and €74 million, respectively, stem from Siemens Healthineers plans. Siemens Healthineers plans are largely similar to Siemens' plans, except for granting Siemens Healthineers AG shares.


##### Stock Awards

The Company grants stock awards to members of the Managing Board, members of the senior management and other eligible employees. Stock awards entitle the beneficiary to Siemens shares without payment of consideration at the end of the vesting period. The vesting period for awards granted to members of the senior management in fiscal 2022 is three years and four years for awards granted prior to fiscal 2022. Awards granted to members of the Managing Board are subject to a four year vesting period.

Stock awards are tied to performance criteria. For stock awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021, 80% of the target amount is linked to the relative total shareholder return of Siemens compared to the total shareholder return of the MSCI World Industrials sector index (TSR- Target); the remaining 20% are linked to a Siemens internal sustainability target considering environmental, social and governance targets (ESG-Target). The annual target amount for stock awards up to and including tranche 2019 is linked to the share price performance of Siemens relative to the share price performance of five important competitors. The target attainment for each individual performance criteria ranges between 0% and 200%. For awards granted since fiscal 2019 settlement is in shares only corresponding to the actual target attainment. Awards granted prior to fiscal 2019, target outperformances in excess of 100% are settled in cash.


###### Commitments to members of the Managing Board

The Managing Board's stock awards are based on criteria described above. Fair values are €10 million and €12 million, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021, calculated by applying a valuation model. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, inputs to that model include an expected weighted volatility of Siemens shares of 24.41% and 24.30%, respectively, and a market price of €153.34 and €112.70 per Siemens share. Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. The model applies a risk-free interest rate of up to (0.15)% and (0.49)% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, and an expected dividend yield of 2.61% in fiscal 2022 and 3.10% in fiscal 2021. Assumptions relating to correlations between the Siemens share price and the development of the MSCI index were derived from historic observations of share price and index changes.

Commitments to members of the senior management and other eligible employees

In fiscal 2022 and 2021, 1,459,182 and 1,975,492 equity-settled stock awards were granted relating to the TSR-Target with a fair value of €106 million and €104 million, respectively. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, 365,610 and 493,472 equity-settled stock awards were granted relating to the ESG-Target with a fair value of €51 million and €48 million, respectively.

The fair value of stock awards granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021 (TSR-related) was calculated applying a valuation model. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, inputs to that model include an expected weighted volatility of Siemens shares of 24.41% and 24.34%, respectively, and a share price per Siemens share of €153.58 and €112.36. Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. The model applies a risk-free interest rate of up to (0.23)% in fiscal 2022 and up to (0.49)% in fiscal 2021 and an expected dividend yield of 2.61% and 3.11% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Assumptions relating to correlations between the Siemens share price and the development of the MSCI Index were derived from historic observations of share price and index changes. The fair value of the ESG component of €140.52 and €97.63 per share in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, was determined as the market price of Siemens shares less the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period.

## Share Matching Program and its underlying plans

In fiscal 2022, Siemens issued a new tranche under each of the plans of the Share Matching Program.


### Share Matching Plan

Under the Share Matching Plan, senior managers may invest a specified part of their variable compensation in Siemens shares (investment shares). The shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter. Plan participants receive the right to one Siemens share without payment of consideration (matching share) for every three investment shares continuously held over a period of about three years (vesting period) provided the plan participant has been continuously employed by Siemens until the end of the vesting period.


### Monthly Investment Plan

Under the Monthly Investment Plan employees other than senior managers may invest a specified part of their compensation in Siemens shares on a monthly basis over a period of twelve months. Shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date once a month. If the Managing Board decides that shares acquired under the Monthly Investment Plan are transferred to the Share Matching Plan, plan participants will receive the right to matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above with a vesting period of about two years. The Managing Board decided that shares acquired under the tranches issued in fiscal 2021 and 2020 are transferred to the Share Matching Plan as of February 2022 and February 2021, respectively.


#### Base Share Program

Under the Base Share Program employees of Siemens AG and participating domestic Siemens companies may invest a fixed amount of their compensation in Siemens shares, sponsored by Siemens. The shares are bought at market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter and grant the right to receive matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above. The fair value of the Base Share Program amounted to €24 million and €25 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Resulting Matching Shares:

| | Fiscal year ||
|| 2022 | 2021 |
| - | - | - |
| Outstanding, beginning of period | 1,389,016 | 1,509,046 |
| Granted | 557,839 | 654,483 |
| Vested and fulfilled | (573.440) | (624,480) |
| Forfeited | (64,030) | (80,385) |
| Settled | (53,561) | (69,648) |
| Outstanding, end of period | 1,255,825 | 1,389,016 |

The weighted average fair value of matching shares granted in fiscal 2022 and 2021 of €121.35 and €96.92 per share, respectively, was determined as the market price of Siemens shares less the present value of expected dividends; non-vesting conditions were taken into account.


## Jubilee Share Program

For their 25th and 40th service anniversary eligible employees receive jubilee shares. There were 3.11 million and 3.15 million entitlements to jubilee shares outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

### Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements

To better address our investors' needs, individual line items of our Profit and Asset reconciliations are displayed in a new structure since fiscal 2022. Essentially, the previous line item Corporate items is split into Governance, Innovation and into financing and other items. The latter were combined with our previous Eliminations, Corporate Treasury and other reconciling items and renamed to Financing, eliminations and other items. Content and measurement principles of reconciling items mainly remained unchanged. Prior period amounts conform to the current period disclosure.

Siemens Energy Investment - includes our investment in Siemens Energy accounted for using the equity method, and previously, a smaller investment in connection with Siemens Energy sold in fiscal 2022.

Siemens Real Estate (SRE) - manages the Group's real estate business portfolio, operates the properties, and is responsible for building projects and the purchase and sale of real estate; excluded is the carved-out real estate of Siemens Healthineers.

Innovation - mainly includes results from our units Technology and Next47.

Governance - primarily includes Siemens brand fees and governance costs, group managing costs, IT and corporate services.

Centrally carried pension expense - includes the Company's pension related income (expense) not allocated to the segments, POC or Siemens Real Estate.

Financing, eliminations and other items - comprise activities of Advanta and Global Business Services, results from corporate projects, equity interests and activities generally intended for closure as well as activities remaining from divestments, consolidation of transactions within the segments, certain reconciliation and reclassification items as well as central financing activities. It also includes interest income and expense, such as, for example, interest not allocated to segments or POC (referred to as financing interest), interest related to central financing activities or resulting consolidation and reconciliation effects on interest.


## Measurement - Segments

Accounting policies for Segment information are generally the same as those used for the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment information is disclosed for continuing operations; prior year Assets are reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. For internal and segment reporting purposes intercompany lease transactions, however, are classified as operating leases by the lessor and are accounted for off-balance sheet by the lessee (except for intercompany leases with Siemens Healthineers as lessees). Intersegment transactions are based on market prices.


## Revenue

Revenue includes revenue from contracts with customers and revenue from leasing activities. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, lease revenue is €1,104 million and €1,050 million, respectively. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, Digital industries recognized €4,691 million and €4,290 million revenue, respectively, from its software business, Smart Infrastructure recognized €3,799 million and €3,387 million in its service business. Revenues of Mobility are mainly derived from construction-type business.

Profit

Siemens' Managing Board is responsible for assessing the performance of the segments (chief operating decision maker). The Company's profitability measure of the segments except for SFS is earnings before interest, certain pension costs, income taxes and amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations as determined by the chief operating decision maker (Profit). The major categories of items excluded from Profit are described below.

Interest income (expenses) are excluded from Profit. Decision-making regarding financing is typically made at the corporate level.

Decisions on essential pension items are made centrally. Accordingly, Profit primarily includes amounts related to service cost of pension plans only, while all other regularly recurring pension related costs are included in reconciliations in line item Centrally carried pension expense.

<!-- PageNumber="40" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Consolidated Financial Statements" -->

Amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations are not part of Profit. Furthermore, income taxes are excluded from Profit since income tax is subject to legal structures, which typically do not correspond to the structure of the segments. The effect of certain litigation and compliance issues is excluded from Profit, if such items are not indicative of performance. This may also be the case for items that refer to more than one reportable segment, SRE and (or) POC or have a corporate or central character. Costs for support functions are primarily allocated to the segments.


### Profit of the segment SFS

In contrast to performance measurement principles applied to other segments, interest income and expenses are included, since interest is an important source of revenue and expense of SFS.


#### Asset measurement principles

Management determined Assets (Net capital employed) as a measure to assess capital intensity of the segments except for SFS. Its definition corresponds to the Profit measure except for amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations which are not part of Profit, however, the related intangible assets are included in the segments' Assets. Segment Assets is based on Total assets of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, primarily excluding intragroup financing receivables, tax related assets and assets of discontinued operations, since the corresponding positions are excluded from Profit. The remaining assets are reduced by non- interest-bearing liabilities other than tax related liabilities, e.g. trade payables, to derive Assets. In contrast, Assets of SFS is Total assets. In individual cases assets of Mobility include project-specific intercompany financing of long-term projects. Assets of Siemens Healthineers include real estate, while real estate of all other segments is carried at SRE.


## Orders

Orders are determined principally as estimated revenue of accepted purchase orders for which enforceable rights and obligations exist as well as subsequent order value changes and adjustments, excluding letters of intent. To determine orders, Siemens considers termination rights and customer's creditworthiness.

As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, order backlog totaled €102 billion and €85 billion (continuing operations); thereof Digital Industries €14 billion and €7 billion, Smart Infrastructure €15 billion and €11 billion, Mobility €36 billion and €36 billion and Siemens Healthineers €34 billion and €27 billion. In fiscal 2023, Siemens expects to convert approximately €45 billion of the September 30, 2022 order backlog into revenue; thereof at Digital Industries approximately €11 billion, Smart Infrastructure approximately €10 billion, Mobility approximately €10 billion and Siemens Healthineers approximately €12 billion.


### Free cash flow definition

Free cash flow of the segments constitutes cash flows from operating activities less additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Except for SFS, it excludes financing interest, except for cases where interest on qualifying assets is capitalized or classified as contract costs; it also excludes income tax as well as certain other payments and proceeds. Free cash flow of SFS includes related financing interest payments and proceeds; income tax payments and proceeds of SFS are excluded. In individual cases, free cash flow of Mobility includes project-specific intercompany financing of long-term projects.


## Amortization, depreciation and impairments

Amortization, depreciation and impairments includes depreciation and impairments of property, plant and equipment as well as amortization and impairments of intangible assets each net of reversals of impairment.


## Measurement - POC and Siemens Real Estate

POC follows the measurement principles of the segments except for SFS. Siemens Real Estate applies the measurement principles of SFS.


### Additional segment information

Mobility was burdened by a negative effect on profit of €0.6 billion for winding down business activities in Russia; it includes a net impact from and in connection with contracts with customers in Russia of €(0.4) billion as well as the impairment of an investment accounted for using the equity method of €0.2 billion. Siemens Financial Services incurred pre-tax losses of €0.2 billion and Financing, eliminations and other items pre-tax losess of €0.5 billion at Corporate Treasury, in connection with the sale of Siemens' financing and leasing business in Russia at the end of fiscal 2022.

### To Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich

Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report


## Opinions

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022, the consolidated statements of financial position as of September 30, 2022, the consolidated statements of cash flows and changes in equity for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the last paragraph of chapter 1 beginning with "Disclosures in accordance with EU taxonomy" of the group management report, the sections "8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM" and "8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)" in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement which is published on the website stated in the combined management report.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

. the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB ["Handelsgesetzbuch": German Commercial Code] as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as of September 30, 2022 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022, and

. the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the group management report does not cover the last paragraph in chapter 1 beginning with "Disclosures in accordance with EU taxonomy" of the group management report, the sections "8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM" and "8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)" in chapter 8.5 of the group management report and the content of the Corporate Governance Statement.

Pursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.


### Basis for the opinions

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as "EU Audit Regulation") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). In conducting the audit of the consolidated financial statements we also complied with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Art. 10 (2) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art. 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.


## Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Below, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:


### Revenue recognition on construction-type contracts

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The Group conducts a significant portion of its business under construction-type contracts, particularly in the Mobility business. Revenue from long-term construction-type contracts is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, generally over time under the percentage-of-completion method. We consider the accounting for construction-type contracts to be an area posing a significant risk of material misstatement (including the potential risk of management override of internal controls) and accordingly a key audit matter, because management's assessments significantly impact the determination of the extent of progress towards completion. These assessments include, in particular, the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill contractually defined obligations, total estimated contract costs, remaining costs to completion and total estimated contract revenues, as well as contract risks including technical, political, regulatory and legal risks.

<!-- PageNumber="2" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Independent Auditor's Reports (Group)" -->

Revenues, total estimated contract costs and profit recognition may deviate significantly from original estimates based on new knowledge about cost overruns and changes in project scope over the term of a construction-type contract.

The sanctions imposed as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the management's decision to wind down the affected businesses have restricted the fulfilment of existing construction-type contracts with Russian customers. The accounting for risks from these contracts is associated with increased uncertainty and complexity, especially with regards to the management's assessments on implications from contract terminations.

Furthermore, the effects of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) as well as current macroeconomic developments on the project business, such as delays in project execution, price increases or disruptions in supply chains as well as change in law clauses with regards to compensation for damages or contractual penalties for delays in delivery and their accounting treatment were of key significance for our audit.

Auditor's response: As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the Group's internally established methods, processes and control mechanisms for project management in the bid and execution phase of construction-type contracts. In this regard, we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the accounting-related internal controls in the project business by obtaining an understanding of business transactions specific to construction-type contracts, from the initiation of the transaction through presentation in the consolidated financial statements. We also tested controls addressing the timely assessment of changes in cost estimates and the timely and complete recognition of such changes in the project calculation.

As part of our substantive audit procedures, which particularly involved project reviews, we evaluated management's estimates and assumptions based on a risk-based selection of a sample of contracts. Our sample primarily included projects that are subject to significant future uncertainties and risks, such as projects with complex safety/technical and regulatory requirements or projects with a large portion of materials and services to be provided by suppliers or consortium partners, fixed-price or turnkey projects, cross-border projects, especially projects with Russian customers, projects affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and projects with changes in cost estimates, delays and/or low or negative margins.

Our audit procedures included, among others, review of the contracts and their terms and conditions including contractually agreed partial deliveries and services, termination rights, penalties for delay and breach of contract, liquidated damages as well as joint and several liability. In order to evaluate whether revenues were recognized on an accrual basis for the selected projects, we analyzed revenues attributable to the fiscal year and corresponding cost of sales to be recognized in the statement of income considering the extent of progress towards completion and examined the accounting for the associated items in the statement of financial position.

For this we also assessed the accounting for contractually agreed options, contract amendments or contract terminations (including related pending legal proceedings) particularly in relation to construction-type contracts with Russian customers in connection with the sanctions against Russia and the Managing Board's decision to wind down the affected businesses. We also assessed the recognition requirements and the recoverability of assets, such as inventories, receivables and reimbursement claims.

We further performed inquiries of project management (both commercial and technical project managers) with respect to the development of the projects including the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 on project execution, the reasons for deviations between planned and actual costs, the current estimated costs to complete the projects, and management's assessments on probabilities that contract risks and claims from joint and several liability will materialize.

To identify anomalies in the development of margins and other project KPIs, we also applied data analysis procedures. In designing our audit procedures, we also considered results from project audits conducted by the internal audit function. Furthermore, we obtained evidence from third parties for selected projects (e.g., project acceptance documentation, contractual terms and conditions, and lawyers' confirmations regarding alleged breaches of contract and asserted claims) and visited plant sites. Due to the large contract volume and risk profile, our audit procedures focused on large contracts for delivery of high-speed and commuter trains and Mobility contracts with Russian customers.

Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to revenue recognition on construction-type contracts.

Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for construction-type contracts, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. With respect to contract assets and liabilities as well as provisions for order related losses and risks, refer to Note 10 Contract assets and liabilities, Note 18 Provisions and Note 21 Commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.


### Valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Since the spin-off of Siemens Energy AG in September 2020, Siemens AG has held a 35.1% stake in the listed Siemens Energy AG and accounts for this investment as an associate applying the equity method in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. During the fiscal year 2022, the market value of the investment was predominantly below the carrying amount, also as of September 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, the market value has declined significantly and an impairment of the investment based on the stock market price was recognized in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets.

Due to the judgments and estimates by management in the analyses and measurements as well as the overall material impact on the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group and the related significant risk of material misstatement, the assessment of an impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG was one of the key audit matters.

Auditor's response: As part of our audit procedures in relation to management's assessment of an impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, we examined the methods and processes defined internally for the identification of objective indicators of impairment and thus the timing of a possible impairment as well as the measurement of an impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG.

With regards to the assessment of whether there are objective indicators of an impairment, in particular regarding the interpretation of a possible significant decline of the fair value, we evaluated management's assessment made on a quarterly and year-end basis as well as management's judgements and estimates contained therein and obtained external evidence on credit ratings, stock market prices,

<!-- PageNumber="m 3" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Independent Auditor's Reports (Group)" -->

analysts' assessments and observable valuation indicators in this regard. In order to evaluate management's assessment as of September 30, 2022, we also considered the parameters and effects of the capital measure taken by the investee in September 2022 and of the expected acquisition of further shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A. by Siemens Energy AG. In addition, with the assistance of internal valuation specialists, we assessed the judgemental assumptions in determining the recoverable amount and the calculation of the impairment loss as of June 30, 2022.

Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures regarding the investment in Siemens Energy AG and its impairment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG as of September 30, 2022.

Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for investments in associates, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Details on the impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG are presented in Note 4 Interests in other entities.

Provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: We considered the accounting for provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, including allegations of corruption and antitrust violations to be a key audit matter. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance. The proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly, considerable management judgment, in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks.

Auditor's response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted are known and to assess management's estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Group entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from in-house legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their probability, obtaining confirmations from external legal advisors and evaluating internal statements concerning the accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.

We further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations (including sanctions) and internal company policies (compliance violations) by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed on this basis whether management's evaluation of any risks to be accounted for in the consolidated financial statements is plausible.

Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures on proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations.

Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for provisions, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. With respect to proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, refer to Note 22 Legal proceedings.


#### Uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Siemens operates in numerous countries with different local tax legislation. The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions, and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the measurement and completeness of deferred tax liabilities as well as the tax assessment of the accounting implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, especially with regard to the tax deductibility of recognized expenses.

Auditor's response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of relevant local tax law, we examined the processes installed by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions.

In the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether management's assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 2022, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from cross border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices, the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company shares and corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities. With regard to the accounting implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict we assessed the deductibility of the respective recognized expenses. In order to assess measurement and completeness, we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. Further, we evaluated management's assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law. In this context we also inspected expert tax opinions and assessments commissioned by management.

In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management's assumptions with respect to tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income, also in view of the implications of current geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, and compared them to internal business plans. In the course of our audit procedures regarding deferred tax liabilities, we examined in

<!-- PageNumber="4 4" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Independent Auditor's Reports (Group)" -->

particular the assumptions regarding reinvestment of subsidiaries' retained profits for an indefinite period and assessed these taking into account dividend planning.

Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes.

Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for income taxes, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. With respect to disclosures for deferred tax assets and liabilities, refer to Note 7 Income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report

Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the IASB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as management has determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. It also has the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, management is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as management has considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.


## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the

<!-- PageNumber="5" -->

<!-- PageNumber="5" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Independent Auditor's Reports (Group)" -->

Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation as well as in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the IDW and in supplementary compliance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

. identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

. obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems;

. evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures;

· conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern;

. evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the IASB;

. obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions;

. Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.

. Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, the related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

Independent auditor's report on a limited assurance engagement on the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy
===


## To Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich

We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the "Disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy" section included in chapter 1 "Organization of the Siemens Group and basis of presentation" of the group management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich (hereinafter the "Company"), which is combined with the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, for the period from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 (hereinafter the "disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy").


## Responsibilities of management

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy in accordance with Art. 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the "EU Taxonomy Regulation") and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as in accordance with their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder that is presented in the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy.

These responsibilities of the Company's management include the selection and application of appropriate EU Taxonomy reporting methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual disclosures that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management considers necessary to enable the preparation of disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (manipulation of the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy) or error.

The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, management has disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.


## Independence and quality assurance of the audit firm

We have complied with the German professional requirements on independence as well as other professional conduct requirements.

Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional pronouncements, in particular the BS WP/vBP ["Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer/vereidigte Buchprüfer": Professional Charter for German Public Accountants/German Sworn Auditors]) in the exercise of their Profession and the IDW Standard on Quality Management issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW): Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QS 1), and accordingly maintains a comprehensive quality management system that includes documented policies and procedures with regard to compliance with professional ethical requirements, professional standards as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.


### Responsibilities of the auditor

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy based on our assurance engagement.

We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): "Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information" issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Company's disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as the interpretation by management disclosed in the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy. In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the auditor.

In the course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, performed the following assurance procedures and other activities:

· Inquiries of relevant employees for the assessment of the process to identify the Taxonomy-eligible economic activities,

. Inquiries of the employees responsible for data capture and consolidation as well as the preparation of the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy, to evaluate the reporting processes, the data capture and compilation methods as well as regarding internal controls to the extent relevant for the limited assurance of the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy,

. Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy,

. Analytical evaluation of data at the level of the Group and businesses as well as service and governance units,

. Inquiries and inspection of documents on a sample basis relating to the collection and reporting of data,

. Evaluation of the presentation of the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy.

<!-- PageNumber="9" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Independent Auditor's Reports (Group)" -->

In determining the disclosures in accordance with Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, management is required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.


## Assurance conclusion

Based on the assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft for the period from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as the interpretation by management as disclosed in the disclosures in accordance with EU Taxonomy.


## Restriction of use

We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company's purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance engagement. As a result, it may not be suitable for another purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be used by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it. Our responsibility is to the Company alone. We do not accept any responsibility to third parties. Our assurance conclusion is not modified in this respect.


## General engagement terms and liability

The "General Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftsprüfer and Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaften [German Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms]" dated January 1, 2017 are applicable to this engagement and also govern our relations with third parties in the context of this engagement (www.de.ey.com/general-engagement-terms). In addition, please refer to the liability provisions contained there in no. 9 and to the exclusion of liability towards third parties. We accept no responsibility, liability or other obligations towards third parties unless we have concluded a written agreement to the contrary with the respective third party or liability cannot effectively be precluded.

I 3. Notes to Annual Financial Statements
===


## 3.1 General Disclosures

Siemens AG has registered offices in Berlin and Munich, Germany. The Company is registered in the commercial register maintained by the local courts in Berlin Charlottenburg, Germany, under the entry number HRB 12300, and in Munich, Germany, under the entry number HRB 6684.

The Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG have been prepared in accordance with the regulations set forth in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG). Amounts are presented in millions of euros (€ million). Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided.


## 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles

Revenue are proceeds from selling and leasing products, providing services and granting licenses, including licensing contracts for the use of the Siemens trademark.

Negative interest from financial investments is presented as a deduction in interest income, and positive interest from borrowings as a deduction in interest expenses.

Intangible assets acquired for consideration are capitalized at acquisition costs and amortized on a straight-line basis over a maximum of five years or, if longer, the contractually agreed useful life. Items are amortized on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. The capitalization option for internally generated intangible assets is not used.

Acquired goodwill is generally amortized systematically over the expected useful life of five to 15 years. The expected useful life is based on the expected use of the acquired businesses and is determined in particular by economic factors such as future growth and profit expectations, synergy effects and employee base.

Property, plant and equipment: The components of production costs are described in the context of the explanations for inventories. In general, property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method. In certain cases, the declining balance method is applied, whereby a switch is made from the declining balance to the straight-line method as soon as the latter results in higher depreciation expense. Items are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. Low-value non-current assets that are subject to wear and tear, movable, and capable of being used independently, are expensed immediately or capitalized and fully depreciated in the year of acquisition.

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment

|||
| - | - |
| ||
| Factory and office buildings | 20 to 50 years |
| Other buildings | 5 to 10 years |
| Technical equipment and machines | mostly 10 years |
| Other equipment, plant and office equipment | 3 to 8 years |
| Equipment leased to others | mostly 3 to 5 years |

Special reserve with an equity portion includes reserves pursuant to Section 6b of the German Income Tax Act (Einkommensteuergesetz), recognized and transferred in fiscal years prior to the transition to regulations of the German Accounting Law Modernisation Act (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz).

Financial assets: Impairment losses are recognized if the decline in value is presumed to be other than temporary. This applies, if objective evidence, particularly events or changes in circumstances, indicate a significant or other than temporary decline in value. In case of an impairment in prior periods, a lower recognized value may not be maintained if the reasons for the impairment do no longer exist.

Inventories are measured at the lower of average acquisition or production costs and daily values. Production costs comprise, in addition to direct costs, an appropriate portion of production and material overheads and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. General administration expenses, expenses for social facilities, voluntary social costs and company pension scheme costs are not capitalized. Write- downs are recorded to cover inventory risks for reduced usability and technological obsolescence as well as in the context of loss-free valuation of unbilled contracts in construction-type and service businesses.

Allowances on receivables are determined on the basis of the probability of default and country risks.

Deferred tax assets for differences between valuations of balance sheet line items in accordance to commercial and tax law and tax loss carryforwards are recognized if a future tax benefit is expected. Deferred tax assets are netted with deferred tax liabilities. Recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise temporary differences of assets, liabilities, and deferred items of entities forming part of the Siemens AG tax group and partnerships to the extent that the recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, or deferred items result in a deductible or taxable amount in the taxable profit (loss) of Siemens AG.

Offsetting of assets and of income and expenses: Siemens AG measures assets at fair value that are designated as being held exclusively to settle specified pension obligations and obligations for early retirement ("Altersteilzeit") arrangements and which cannot be accessed by other creditors. Income and expenses relating to these designated assets are offset against the expenses arising from compounding the corresponding obligations and are reported within the line item Other financial income (expenses), net.

Pensions and similar commitments: Siemens AG measures its pension obligations using the settlement amount calculated with the actuarial projected unit credit method on the basis of biometric probabilities. The discount rate used corresponds to the average market interest rate for instruments with an assumed remaining maturity of 15 years as published by German Federal Reserve Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank).

<!-- PageNumber="5 5" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Annual Financial Statements" -->

Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at the balance sheet date. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the pension provision is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting to a present value.

According to the Act on the Improvement of Company Pensions (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der betrieblichen Altersversorgung), Siemens AG is secondarily liable for pension benefits provided under an indirect pension funding vehicle (mittelbarer Durchführungsweg). Siemens AG recognizes the underfunding in the item Provisions for pensions and similar commitments as far as the respective assets of the pension fund or of the pension and support fund (Pensions- und Unterstützungskasse) do not cover the settlement amount of the respective pension obligations.

Other provisions are recognized in an appropriate and sufficient amount to cover individual obligations for all identifiable risks relating to liabilities of uncertain timing and amount and for anticipated losses on onerous contracts, taking account of price and cost increases expected to arise in the future. Provisions for agreed personnel restructuring measures were recognized for legal and constructive obligations. Significant provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted using a discount rate which corresponds to the average market interest rate appropriate for the remaining term of the obligations, as calculated and published by Deutsche Bundesbank.

Foreign currency translation: Receivables, other current assets, securities, cash and cash equivalents, provisions and liabilities (excluding advance payments received on orders) as well as commitments and contingencies denominated in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Balance Sheet line items denominated in foreign currency which are part of a valuation unit used to hedge foreign currency risk are measured using the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date. Non-current assets and inventories acquired in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date.

Guarantees and other commitments: Siemens AG issues parent company guarantees, i.e. guarantees to ensure performance obligations incurred from the delivery of goods or provision of services by affiliated and long-term investee companies or their parent companies. For measurement purposes, the contract amount of the secured delivery or service agreement is reduced using the straight-line method over the planned term of the delivery or service agreement, unless there are reasons for a different risk assessment and an increased liability amount ("risk-adequate liability amount"). Credit lines included in the guarantee obligations in the context of financing affiliated companies are recognized at their nominal amount.

Derivative financial instruments are used by Siemens AG almost exclusively for hedging purposes and - if the relevant conditions are met - are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. When a valuation unit is created, changes in values or cash flows from the hedged item and hedging contract are compared. A provision is recognized only for a negative surplus from the ineffective part of the market value changes. The unrealized gains and losses from the effective part offset each other completely and are not recognized in the Balance Sheet or the Income Statement.

Classification of items in the annual financial statements: Siemens AG aggregates individual line items of the Income Statement and Balance Sheet if the individual line item is not material for providing a true and fair view of the Company's financial position and if such an aggregation improves the clarity of the presentation. Siemens AG discloses these items separately in the notes.

### Subscribed capital

The capital stock of Siemens AG is divided into 850,000,000 registered shares of no-par value with a notional value of €3.00 per share.


#### Authorized capital (not issued)

As of September 30, 2022, Siemens AG had authorized capital totaling a nominal amount of €600 million, which can be issued in instalments and with different time limits by issuing up to 200 million registered no-par value shares.

In detail, there are the following authorizations to increase the capital stock:

. By resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of February 3, 2021, the Managing Board is authorized to increase the capital stock until February 2, 2026 by up to €90 million through the issuance of up to 30 million Siemens shares against contributions in cash (Authorized Capital 2021). Subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded. The new shares may exclusively be offered to employees of Siemens AG and its affiliated companies (employee shares). To the extent permitted by law, employee shares may also be issued in such a manner that the contribution to be paid on such shares is covered by that part of the annual net income which the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board may allocate to other retained earnings under Section 58 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.

. Further, by resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of January 30, 2019, the Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until January 29, 2024 by up to €510 million through the issuance of up to 170 million registered no-par value shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind (Authorized Capital 2019). Under certain conditions, the Managing Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights in the event of issue against contributions in kind. In the case of issue against cash payment, the shares are generally to be offered to shareholders for subscription. However, the Managing Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude subscription rights, firstly for any fractional amounts, secondly, to grant dilution compensation in connection with convertible bonds or bonds with warrants already issued, and thirdly, under certain further conditions, if the issue price of the new shares does not fall significantly below the stock exchange price of the Company's already listed shares.


##### Treasury shares

The following table presents the development of treasury shares:

| (in number of shares) | Fiscal year 2022 |
| - | - |
| Treasury shares, beginning of fiscal year | 47,644,581 |
| Share buyback | 14,185,791 |
| Issuance under share-based payments and employee share programs | (4,376,201) |
| Treasury shares, end of fiscal year | 57,454,171 |

Siemens AG held 57,454,171 treasury shares, equaling a nominal amount of €172 million, representing 6.8% of the capital stock.

On June 24, 2021, Siemens announced a share buyback with a volume of up to €3 billion in the period from the beginning of fiscal 2022 to 2026. The share buyback, which began on November 15, 2021 and will run no longer than until September 15, 2026, is executed based on the authorizations granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020. In addition to the dividend policy, the share buyback is intended to allow shareholders to continuously participate in the success of the Company. In fiscal 2022, Siemens AG repurchased a total of 14, 185,791 treasury shares under this buyback program. This represented a nominal amount of €43 million or 1.7% of capital stock. In this reporting period, €1,566 million (excluding incidental transaction charges) were spent for this purpose; this represents a weighted average stock price of €110.38 per share. The purchases were made in the reporting period on 218 Xetra trading days and were carried out by a bank that had been commissioned by Siemens AG; the shares were purchased exclusively on the electronic trading platform of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra). The average volume on these trading days was about 65,072 shares.

The treasury shares purchased under the share buybacks may be used for purposes of retirement, distribution to employees, members of the executive bodies of companies affiliated with Siemens and members of the Managing Board, as well as the servicing of convertible bonds with attached warrants.

<!-- PageNumber="11" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Annual Financial Statements" -->

In fiscal 2022, Siemens AG re-issued in total 4,376,201 treasury shares under the exclusion of subscription rights in connection with share- based payments and employee share programs in the Group, equaling a nominal amount of €13 million and 0.5% of the capital stock. The Company received in total €255 million for 2,004,924 shares, re-issued against payment of a purchase price. Siemens AG received this amount for unrestricted use. All shares were sold as investment shares in connection with the share matching program to plan participants. In each case, the purchase price was determined on the basis of the closing rate in Xetra trading, determined on a monthly effective date. Therefore, in the reporting period, in total 1,405,428 shares related to the monthly investment plan at a weighted average share price of €122.02 per share, 259,927 shares related to the share matching plan at a weighted average share price of €139.50 per share, and 339,569 shares related to the base share program at a weighted average share price of €69.75 per share (after consideration of a 50% subsidy by the Company). The other shares re-issued during the reporting period can be primarily attributed to the servicing of stock awards granted in fiscal 2018 totaling 1,699,017 shares, to 573,441 matching shares under the share matching program for fiscal 2019, and to 98,819 jubilee shares.

Information on amounts subject to dividend payout restrictions

These amounts subject to dividend payout restrictions face other retained earnings in a sufficiently high amount. The unappropriated net income of €3,613 million is available for distribution.


#### Disclosures on shareholdings of Siemens AG

As of September 30, 2022, the following information on shareholdings subject to reporting requirements was available to the Company pursuant to Section 160 para 1 No. 8 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz):

BlackRock, Inc., Wilmington, USA, notified us on June 21, 2022, that its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG amounted to 6.25% (53, 108,691 voting rights) on June 16, 2022.

The State of Qatar, Doha, acting by and through the DIC Company Limited, notified us on May 10, 2012, that its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG exceeded the threshold of 3% of the voting rights in our Company on May 7, 2012 and amounted to 3.04% (27,758,338 voting rights) as per this date.

The Werner Siemens-Stiftung, Zug, Switzerland, notified us on January 21, 2008, that its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG exceeded the threshold of 3% of the voting rights in our Company on January 2, 2008 and amounted to 3.03% (27,739,285 voting rights) as per this date.


## NOTE 16 Provisions for pensions and similar commitments

In Germany, Siemens AG provides pension benefits through the BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans and deferred compensation plans. The majority of Siemens' active employees participate in the BSAV. The benefits are predominantly based on nominal contributions by the Company and investment returns on assets designated to that plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the Company. In connection with the implementation of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases. Therefore, valuation assumptions for salary and pension increases including career trend are no longer significant for the pension obligation of Siemens AG. The pension benefits are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). A portion of these trust assets also covers the pension obligations of other domestic subsidiaries. Therefore, the assets do not meet the criteria for offsetting against the pension obligation and are presented as financial assets of Siemens AG.

The actuarial valuation of the settlement amount as of September 30, 2022 was based, among others, on a discount rate of 1.78% (2021:1.98%) and on a rate of pension progression of 2.00% (inflation-related increase compared to prior year-rate of 1.50%) per year, except for the BSAV and deferred compensation plans with 1.00% (2021: 1.00%) per year. The mortality tables used (Siemens Bio 2017/2022) are primarily based on data of the German Siemens population, using a set of formulas that corresponds to generally accepted actuarial standards.


## NOTE 17 Other provisions

The major amounts in other provisions were contributed by provisions related to personnel costs amounting to €1,026 million, provisions for contingent losses from derivative financial instruments amounting to €782 million, provisions for warranties, delay compensations, penalties for delay and breach of contract amounting to €634 million, provisions for decontamination obligations amounting to €493 million, and provisions related to guarantees and expected obligations from consortium agreements amounting to €187 million.

In May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a public-law contract based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of €360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to measure the obligations that remain with Siemens AG, with regard to conditioning and packaging of nuclear waste, as well as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility "Schacht Konrad" or a logistics depot until year-end 2032.

| thereof Others | 10,411 |
| Guarantees and other commitments | 109,477 |

<!-- PageNumber="14" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Annual Financial Statements" -->

Warranty obligations relating to financing of affiliated companies included guarantees towards banks for credit lines granted to affiliated companies.

The items Obligations from guarantees and Warranty Obligations - Others included guarantees and other commitments for the benefit of companies of the Siemens Energy Group totaling €0.4 billion and €7.2 billion, respectively, with corresponding full reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG. In addition, the items included indemnifications issued in connection with dispositions of businesses. Such indemnifications, if customary to the relevant transactions, may protect the buyer from potential tax, legal and other risks in conjunction with the purchased business.

Warranty obligations included obligations of Siemens AG towards affiliated companies totaling €0.5 billion.

Siemens AG only enters into guarantees and other commitments after careful consideration of the risks concerned and in general only in relation to its own business activities or those of affiliated companies as well as to business activities of companies, if it holds an investment in them or their parent companies. Based on an ongoing risk evaluation of the arrangements entered into and taking into account all information available up to the date on which the Annual Financial Statements were issued for approval, Siemens AG concluded that the relevant primary debtors are able to fulfill the underlying obligations. For this reason, Siemens AG considered it not probable that it will be called upon in conjunction with any of the guarantees and commitments described above.

Siemens AG has entered into a contract to pay its affiliated company Siemens Trademark GmbH & Co. KG, Germany, a running royalty for the use of the Siemens trademark rights. The fee is calculated by applying business-specific royalty rates to brand-related revenue. The contract has an indefinite duration. For fiscal 2022, the corresponding expenses amounted to €804 million. For fiscal 2023, the royalty is expected to be in the same magnitude.

In the course of its normal business operations, Siemens AG is involved in numerous legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations (legal proceedings) in various jurisdictions. These legal proceedings could result in particular in the Company being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or criminal or civil sanctions, fines or disgorgements of profit. In individual cases, this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be expanded. Some of these legal proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens AG that may have material effects on its financial position, the results of its operations and/or its cash flows in the respective reporting period. In addition, Siemens is jointly and severally liable within consortia. As far as not recognized in the financial statements, Siemens AG did not expect any material negative effects on its financial position, the results of its operations and/or its cash flows at balance sheet date.


### NOTE 26 Derivative financial instruments and valuation units

As a consequence of its global operating, investing and financing activities, Siemens AG is in particular exposed to risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, managed in line with a proven risk management system in consideration of defined risk limits. As the parent company of the Siemens Group, Siemens AG has the central role within the group-wide management of financial market risks. To manage the risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, Siemens AG uses primarily foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps as well as combined interest and foreign currency swaps. Thereby the operating units of Siemens AG are not allowed to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The contract partners of the Company for derivative financial instruments are banks, brokers and affiliated companies. The credit rating for banks and brokers is constantly monitored.

As of September 30, 2022, interest rate swaps with a net negative fair value of €635 million (notional amount: €10,005 million) were not included in a valuation unit. For interest rate swaps with a negative fair value of €782 million, provisions for contingent losses were recognized in the same amount. The notional amount equals the contract value of the individual derivative financial instruments before netting (gross notional amount), independent of the type of contracted position (purchase or sale).

The notional amounts equal the contractual amounts of the individual derivative financial instrument which - irrespective of the nature of the concluded position (sale or purchase) - are presented on a gross basis (gross notional amounts).

Fair values of interest rate derivative financial instruments are determined by discounting expected future cash flows over the remaining term of the instrument using current market interest rates and yield curves.

Provided the relevant conditions are met, derivative financial instruments are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. Using the freezing method, the hedging transactions are not recognized in the balance sheet. The effectiveness of the valuation unit is either ensured through risk management, or is demonstrated both prospectively and retrospectively based on appropriate methods used to demonstrate effectiveness (e.g. dollar offset method, regression method, sensitivity analysis). Valuation gains and losses from derivative financial instruments and hedged items are netted for each valuation unit. A provision for anticipated losses on onerous contracts is recognized for the respective valuation unit in the amount of an existing loss surplus. Profit surpluses are not recognized.

Valuation unit used to hedge the foreign currency risk

According to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is generally hedged approximately by 100% with Corporate Treasury. Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from planned business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with Corporate Treasury within a band of 75% to 100% for a hedging period of at least three months.

The remaining foreign currency risk after offsetting cash flows in the same currency is hedged by the Corporate Treasury with external contract partners. The net foreign currency position (before hedging) is combined with the offsetting foreign currency exchange contracts to a macro valuation unit. For this purpose, hedged items and hedging instruments are measured with the respective underlying discounted cash flows. For foreign currency derivative financial instruments, the determination is based on the changes in relevant forward exchange rates. The existing derivative currency hedging contracts are included in the valuation unit in their entirety and had maturity terms until the year 2042. The cash in- and outflows from the foreign currency exchange contracts, firm commitments and forecast transactions are disclosed on a net basis in the following table.

| (in millions of €) | Sep 30, 2022 |
| - | - |
| Foreign currency risk from balance sheet items | 2,243 |
| thereof assets | 16,368 |
| thereof liabilities | (14,124) |
| Foreign currency risk from firm commitments and forecast transactions | 759 |
| thereof expected cash inflows from firm commitments and forecasted transactions | 1,239 |
| thereof expected cash outflows from firm commitments and forecasted transactions | (480) |
| Net foreign currency position (before hedging) | 3,002 |
| Foreign currency exchange contracts (net face value) | (3,305) |
| thereof with external contract partners | 6,026 |
| thereof with affiliated companies | (9,331) |
| Net foreign currency position (after hedging) | (303) |

Firm commitments and forecast transactions concern business transactions for which a legally binding contract was concluded but not yet performed on by either contracting party, as well as contingent payment claims for already partially completed performance obligations in the project and product businesses.

The net fair value of derivative financial instruments from foreign currency hedge accounting was €633 million as of September 30, 2022; positive fair values were €3,814 million and negative fair values were €3,181 million. Accordingly, no provision for anticipated losses was recognized for the derivative financial instruments with negative fair values that were included in this macro valuation unit.


#### Valuation unit used to hedge the interest rate risk

The interest rate hedging contracts used by Siemens AG serve to reduce interest rate risks within the framework of an integrated asset- liability management approach and to optimize the interest results.

Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties to hedge interest rate swaps transacted with its affiliated companies against interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2022, the interest rate swaps transacted with affiliated companies included in this macro valuation unit had a notional amount of €1,163 million and maximum maturity terms until the year 2028. At balance sheet date, these underlying transactions were matched by external interest rate derivatives in the same amount. Thereby, positive fair values of €105 million were offset by negative fair values in the same amount.

To hedge receivables from affiliated companies against interest rate risk, Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties and combined these instruments with the underlying transactions in a macro valuation unit. As of September 30, 2022, the notional amount of the receivables, which had a maximum maturity until the year 2047, amounted to €15,966 million. As of September 30, 2022, the negative cumulative market value changes of these receivables of €504 million were matched by offsetting interest rate derivatives with a positive net fair value of €257 million and a maximum maturity until the year 2041, of which positive fair values were €547 million and negative fair values were €290 million.

To hedge payables to affiliated companies against interest rate risk, Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties. The payables hedged within this micro valuation unit had a nominal volume of €2,551 million as of September 30, 2022 and a maximum maturity until the year 2025. As of September 30, 2022, positive cumulative changes in market value of these payables of €125 million were matched by external interest rate derivatives with identical maturities whose negative market value was €100 million.

The amount of interest rate risks hedged with the valuation unit that did not lead to a provision for anticipated losses accordingly totaled €494 million.


#### NOTE 27 Proposal for the appropriation of net income

The Supervisory Board and the Managing Board propose the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, amounting to €3,613 million to be appropriated as follows: Distribution of a dividend of €4.25 on each share of no par value entitled to the dividend, and carry-forward of the unappropriated net income for shares of no par value not entitled to the dividend.

## To Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich

Report on the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report


## Opinions

We have audited the annual financial statements of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich, (the Company) which comprise the income statement for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022, the balance sheet as of September 30, 2022 and notes to the financial statements, including the recognition and measurement policies presented therein. In addition, we have audited the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the group management report, for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the last paragraph of chapter 1 beginning with "Disclosures in accordance with EU taxonomy" of the combined management report, the sections "8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM" and "8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)" in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement which is published on the website stated in the combined management report.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

. the accompanying annual financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law applicable to business corporations and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 in compliance with German legally required accounting principles, and

. the accompanying management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position. In all material respects, this management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the management report does not cover the last paragraph in chapter 1 beginning with "Disclosures in accordance with EU taxonomy" of the combined management report, the sections "8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM" and "8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)" in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report and the content of the Corporate Governance Statement.

Pursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the annual financial statements and of the management report.


### Basis for the opinions

We conducted our audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as "EU Audit Regulation") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). In conducting the audit of the annual financial statements we also complied with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Art. 10 (2) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art. 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report.


## Key audit matters in the audit of the annual financial statements

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual financial statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Below, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:


### Impairment of non-current financial assets

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The impairment test of non-current financial assets was a key audit matter, as in particular shares in affiliated companies and investments, especially the investment in Siemens Energy AG, entail a higher risk of material misstatement due to the materiality of these assets as well as the estimation uncertainties and judgments involved in assessing whether there is objective evidence to indicate a lower net realizable value and permanent impairment, and the determination of the fair values. In case of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, in which 26.7% is held directly, the market capitalization during fiscal 2022 was below the book value sometimes significantly. As of September 30, 2022, an impairment of the investment to the stock market price has been recorded.

The determination of the fair values of non-current financial assets also depends to a large extent on the assessment of future cash inflows, in individual cases particularly considering the potential effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic, and the discount rate applied.

Auditor's response: In assessing whether there was objective evidence to indicate a lower net realizable value and permanent impairment, we obtained an understanding of management's evaluation and also obtained external evidence in this regard, amongst others, on the development of stock market prices. With regard to the net realizable values calculated by management and its assessment as to whether

<!-- PageNumber="2 N" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Independent Auditor's Report (Siemens AG)" -->

an impairment is expected to be permanent, we examined the underlying processes related to the planning of future cash flows as well as to the calculation of net realizable value.

We assessed the underlying valuation models for the determination of the net realizable value in terms of methodology and reperformed the calculations with the assistance of internal valuation specialists. We further obtained explanations from management regarding material value drivers of the planning, particularly considering the potential effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic, and examined whether the budget planning reflects general and industry-specific market expectations. Decisions of the Managing Board regarding the termination of business activities in Russia were taken into account. Forecast accuracy was assessed on a sample basis using budget-to-actual comparisons of historically forecast data with the actual results. The parameters used to estimate net realizable value such as the estimated growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital rates were assessed by comparing them to publicly available market data. We also performed our own sensitivity analyses to assess the impairment risk in the case of a reasonably possible change in one of the significant assumptions.

With regard to the impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, we have traced the development of the stock market price and assessed the determination of the fair value as well as the calculation of the impairment as of September 30, 2022. Furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures regarding the investment in Siemens Energy AG and its impairment in the notes to the financial statements.

Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to assessing the impairment of non-current financial assets.

Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied for the impairment of non-current financial assets, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles in the notes to the financial statements and with respect to write-downs and write-ups of non-current financial assets, refer to chapter 3.3 Notes to the Income Statement, Note 3 Income (loss) from investments, net as well as chapter 3.4 Notes to the Balance Sheet, Note 10 Non-current assets in the notes to the financial statements.

Other Provisions for legal disputes, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: We considered the accounting for other provisions for legal disputes, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations (legal proceedings) out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations to be a key audit matter. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance. The proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly, considerable management judgment, in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks.

Auditor's response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted also in connection with joint and several liability are known and to assess management's estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Company entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from in-house legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their probability, obtaining confirmations from external legal advisors and evaluating internal statements concerning the accounting treatment in the annual financial statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.

We further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations (including sanctions) and internal company policies (compliance violations) by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed on this basis whether management's evaluation of any risks to be accounted for in the annual financial statements is plausible.

Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations.

Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for other provisions, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles in the notes to the financial statements. With respect to the legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations, refer to chapter 3.5 Other Disclosures, Note 25 Other financial obligations.

Uncertain tax positions and recoverability of deferred tax assets

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions, and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred tax assets as well as management's assessments regarding the tax implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, especially with regard to the tax deductibility of recognized expenses.

Auditor's response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of tax law, we examined the processes installed by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions.

In the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether management's assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 2022, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from cross border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices, the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company shares and corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities. With regard to the accounting implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict we assessed the deductibility of the respective recognized expenses. In order to assess measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. Further, we evaluated management's assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law. In this context we also inspected expert tax opinions and assessments commissioned by management.

<!-- PageNumber="m 3" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Independent Auditor's Report (Siemens AG)" -->

In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management's assumptions with respect to tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income, also in view of the implications of current geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, and compared them to internal business plans.

Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for income taxes, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles and chapter 3.3 Notes to the Income Statement, Note 6 Income taxes and with respect to disclosures for deferred tax assets, refer to chapter 3.4 Notes to the Balance Sheet, Note 13 Deferred tax assets in the notes to the financial statements.

In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as management has considered necessary to enable the preparation of a management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the management report.

The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process for the preparation of the annual financial statements and of the management report.

## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the annual financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation as well as in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the IDW and in supplementary compliance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual financial statements and this management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

. identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual financial statements and of the management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the annual financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems of the Company;

. evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures;

· conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual financial statements and in the management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to be able to continue as a going concern;

. evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the annual financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German legally required accounting principles;

. evaluate the consistency of the management report with the annual financial statements, its conformity with German law and the view of the Company's position it provides;

. perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, the related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the annual financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.


## Other legal and regulatory requirements

Report on the assurance on the electronic rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report prepared for publication purposes in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB


## Opinion

We have performed assurance work in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report (hereinafter the "ESEF documents") contained in the file SIEMENS\_2022.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format ("ESEF format"). In accordance with German legal requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the annual financial statements and the management report into the ESEF format and therefore relates neither to the information contained within these renderings nor to any other information contained in the file identified above.

In our opinion, the rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report contained in the file identified above and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying annual financial statements and the accompanying

<!-- PageNumber="5 5" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Independent Auditor's Report (Siemens AG)" -->

management report for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 contained in the "Report on the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report" above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the file identified above.


### Basis for the opinion

We conducted our assurance work on the rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report contained in the file identified above in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB and the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AsS 410) (10.2021) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised). Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents" section. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management 1: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QS 1).


### Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF documents

Management is responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the electronic rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report in accordance with Sec. 328 (1) Sentence 4 No. 1 HGB.

In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as it has determined necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format.

The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.


#### Auditor's responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:

. identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion;

. obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls;

. evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the financial statements, on the technical specification for this file;

. evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited annual financial statements and to the audited management report.


## Further information pursuant to Art. 10 of the EU Audit Regulation

We were elected as auditor by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 10, 2022. We were engaged by the Supervisory Board on February 10, 2022. We have been the auditor of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft without interruption since the fiscal year from October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009.

We declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee pursuant to Art. 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).

In addition to the financial statement audit, we have provided to the Company or entities controlled by it the following services that are not disclosed in the annual financial statements or in the management report:

In addition to auditing the statutory financial statements of Siemens AG, we performed the statutory audit of Siemens' consolidated financial statements, audits of financial statements of subsidiaries of Siemens AG, reviews of interim financial statements integrated in the audit, project-based IT audits, audit services in connection with the implementation of new accounting standards as well as service organization control engagements.

Audit-related services include primarily audits of financial statements as well as other attestation services in connection with M&A activities, attestation services related to the sustainability reporting, the compensation reporting and the EU Taxonomy, comfort letters and other attestation services required under regulatory requirements, contractually agreed or requested on a voluntary basis.


## Other matter - use of the auditor's report

Our auditor's report must always be read together with the audited annual financial statements and the audited management report as well as the assured ESEF documents. The annual financial statements and the management report converted to the ESEF format - including the versions to be published in the Bundesanzeiger [German Federal Gazette] - are merely electronic renderings of the audited annual financial statements and the audited management report and do not take their place. In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.

A. Fiscal 2022 in retrospect
===

What did the economic and political environment look like at the start of fiscal 2022?

In the fall of 2021, the starting position for fiscal 2022 was beset by many uncertainties. The COVID-19 pandemic had not yet peaked, and there was a risk of further, more-contagious or more-severe virus variants. Supply chain bottlenecks continued as did the trade conflict between the U.S. and China. The already tense geopolitical situation further deteriorated dramatically due to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. Inflation subsequently rose to heights not seen in decades, triggered mainly by large price jumps in the energy sector. Siemens withdrew from Russia following the imposition of international sanctions. This move had a negative impact on the Company's profit as did the necessary impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy. However, Siemens AG proved, in retrospect, to be very strong: the Company leveraged growth opportunities in many key markets. The Siemens team delivered a very good operating performance in extremely challenging times.


## How is the strategy reflected in Managing Board compensation?

Siemens positioned itself as a leading technology company focused on accelerated high-value growth. The Supervisory Board is convinced that this strategy positions Siemens to meet the challenges of the future. The Managing Board compensation that has been determined by the Supervisory Board fosters the implementation of the Company's strategic targets by providing incentives for increasing profit and capital efficiency and for cash generation.

In addition, sustainability - as a strategic goal and an expression of Siemens' social responsibility - is a high priority at Siemens. Sustainability is managed using the DEGREE framework. Introduced in fiscal 2021, this framework addresses sustainability from every angle and determines Siemens' ambitions in the sustainability area with systematized, measurable and specific long-term targets for environment, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. DEGREE is an acronym that stands for decarbonization, ethics, governance, resource efficiency, equity and employability. The DEGREE framework is continuously developed and adapted to the commitments that Siemens has made, such as the Science Based Targets initiative. The key performance indicators applied in long-term variable compensation are part of this DEGREE framework (CO2 emissions and digital learning hours per employee) and/or reflect the Company's priorities (Net Promoter Score as an expression of customer satisfaction).


## How did Siemens perform in fiscal 2022?

Siemens was very successful in fiscal 2022 despite the complex geopolitical and economic environment. Many of our key customer industries - including automotive, machine building, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, electronics, cloud services and public transport - kept growing, and we continued to successfully avoid major supply chain disruptions.

Our Industrial Business again achieved excellent results, particularly in Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Siemens Healthineers. Results at Mobility were strongly impacted by the negative effects of withdrawing from business activities in Russia. Outside Industrial Business, exiting our financing and leasing activities in Russia resulted in further charges. A significant decline in the market value of Siemens Energy AG also led to an impairment of our stake in that company as of June 30, 2022.

Revenue increased at all our industrial businesses and, including positive currency translation effects, climbed 16% to €72.0 billion. Net of currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens grew 8.2%. Profit Industrial Business rose 17% to a record high of €10.3 billion. Our Industrial Business generated a strong profit margin of 15.1%.

Despite the excellent performance of our Industrial Business and a net gain of €2.2 billion from the successful further focusing of our business, which included gains from the divestments of Siemens Logistics' mail and parcel business and Yunex Traffic, Siemens' net income declined to €4.4 billion. This decline was chiefly due to the €2.7 billion impairment of

<!-- PageNumber="FISCAL 2022 4" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Compensation Report > A. Fiscal 2022 in retrospect" -->

our stake in Siemens Energy AG and a negative effect of €1.3 billion related to our previously mentioned decision to exit business activities in Russia. Basic earnings per share (EPS) from net income came in at €4.65, and earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA) was €5.47. The impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG burdened basic EPS from net income and EPS pre PPA by €3.37 per share.

The impairment of our stake in Siemens Energy AG burdened return on capital employed (ROCE) by 5.3 percentage points, resulting in ROCE of 10.0% for fiscal 2022.

Free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal 2022 was €8.2 billion, reaching the high level of fiscal 2021. The cash conversion rate for Siemens, defined as the ratio of free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to net income, was 1.86, exceeding our targeted cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate for Siemens.

Siemens' strong operating performance in fiscal 2022 is reflected in the Managing Board's variable compensation, which takes into account not only financial success but also environmental and social aspects. As a result, the compensation of the Managing Board members is also oriented toward the interests of the shareholders as well as the other stakeholders of Siemens AG.

Composition of the Managing Board and the Compensation Committee

There were no changes in the composition of the Managing Board of Siemens AG or in the Compensation Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG in fiscal 2022.

In fiscal 2022, the Managing Board comprised Dr. Roland Busch (President and CEO), Cedrik Neike, Matthias Rebellius, Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas and Judith Wiese.

In fiscal 2022, the Compensation Committee comprised Michael Diekmann (Chairman), Harald Kern, Jürgen Kerner, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Birgit Steinborn and Matthias Zachert.

Vote on the Compensation Report for fiscal 2021 at the 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meeting

The Compensation Report for fiscal 2021 was prepared for the first time in accordance with Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and its content was also audited by the independent auditors, beyond the requirement of Section 162 para. 3 sent. 1 and 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act. The Compensation Report on the compensation individually awarded and due to the members of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG in fiscal 2021 was approved by a majority of 91.70% at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 10, 2022.

In discussions between the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and investors, we received very positive feedback on the structure and transparency of the Compensation Report for fiscal 2021. The suggestions for improvement mentioned in these discussions have been taken into account in the current Compensation Report for fiscal 2022. To make compensation reporting even more transparent, chapter B.3.1 SHORT-TERM VARIABLE COMPENSATION (BONUS) has been expanded to include further details of the Managing Board members' individual targets. Chapter B.3.2 LONG-TERM VARIABLE COMPENSATION (STOCK AWARDS) has also been expanded to include further information on the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index.

In view of the high level of approval of the application of the compensation system in fiscal 2021 and taking into account regular feedback from investors, no changes to the compensation system were deemed necessary in fiscal 2022. Pursuant to Section 120a para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the compensation system for Managing Board members must be presented to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for approval in February 2024. In this connection, a comprehensive audit of the current compensation system is planned for fiscal 2023.

B. Compensation of Managing Board members
===


## B. 1 The compensation system at a glance

The current compensation system for the members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG has been in place since fiscal 2020 and was endorsed by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020, by a majority of 94.51%.

The compensation of the Managing Board members consists of fixed and variable components. Fixed compensation, which is not performance-based, comprises base salary, fringe benefits and a pension benefit commitment. Short-term variable compensation (Bonus) and long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards) are performance-based compensation and thus variable.

The Share Ownership Guidelines are a further key component of the compensation system. They obligate Managing Board members to permanently hold Siemens shares worth a defined multiple of their base salary and to purchase additional shares in the event that the value of their shares falls below the defined amount.

The Managing Board compensation system is also supplemented by commitments granted in connection with the commencement and termination of appointments to the Managing Board as well as any change in the regular place of work.

B.2 Principles of the determination of compensation
===


## B.2.1 Target compensation and compensation structure

The Supervisory Board has determined, in accordance with the compensation system for the Managing Board members, the amount of each Managing Board member's total target compensation for fiscal 2022. In making this determination, the Supervisory Board has ensured that the proportion of long-term variable compensation always exceeds that of short-term variable compensation and that the proportions of total target compensation represented by each of the individual compensation components are within the ranges defined in the compensation system.

</figure>


As part of its regular review to determine the appropriateness of Managing Board income and the latter's conformity with market conditions, the Supervisory Board approved, at its meeting on September 23, 2021, an increase in the total target compensation of Dr. Roland Busch effective October 1, 2021. This increase was implemented by raising his Stock Awards target amount to €2,954,000 from €2,390,000.

In addition, the Supervisory Board decided at its meeting on December 2, 2021, to extend the appointment of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas until December 2026. In connection with this extension, the Supervisory Board approved retroactively an increase in the total target compensation of Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas effective October 1, 2021. This increase was implemented by raising his Stock Awards target amount to €2,000,000 from €1,544,000.

By increasing the Stock Awards target amounts, variable compensation is structured on a more long-term basis, while compensation as a whole is oriented even more toward sustainable Company development.

Regarding compensation, all components of the compensation of the position of President and CEO are differentiated. The target amount of Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas's Stock Awards is differentiated due to his particular responsibilities as CFO.

The following table shows the individualized target compensation of each Managing Board member and the relative proportions of total target compensation represented by each of the individual compensation components.

1 For fiscal 2022, each Managing Board member was awarded fringe benefits equal to a maximum 7.5% of his or her base salary. The target amount reported here is also equal to the maximum amount.

2 Matthias Rebellius and Judith Wiese are not included in the Siemens Defined Contribution Pension Plan (BSAV). Instead of BSAV contributions, they receive a fixed cash amount for free disposal.

<!-- PageFooter="FISCAL 2022 11" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Compensation Report > B. Compensation of Managing Board members" -->


### B.2.2 Maximum compensation

The maximum compensation of each Managing Board member is determined annually by the Supervisory Board in accordance with Section 87a para. 1 sent. 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act. Maximum compensation is equal to the total of the maximum amounts of all compensation components that can possibly be paid out to each Managing Board member for the relevant fiscal year. It is calculated by adding base salary, maximum fringe benefits and the BSAV contribution (or the amount for free disposal) as well as two times the Bonus target amount and three times the Stock Awards target amount. Twice the Bonus target amount and triple the Stock Awards target amount also correspond to the respective limits (individual caps) on the amount of variable compensation.

The following table shows the maximum compensation of each Managing Board member as approved by the Supervisory Board for fiscal 2022 in accordance with Section 87a para. 1 sent. 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act.

| Maximum compensation fiscal 2022 ||||||||
| (€ thousand) | || Managing Board members in office on September 30, 2022 |||||

||| + Fringe benefits (maximum amount)  | 133 | 83 | 83 | 83 | 83 |
||| BSAV contribution / amount for free disposal | 991 | 617 | 551 | 617 | 551 |
|| + |||||||

|| | | | | ||| + (three times target amount)  | 8,862 | 3,777 | 3,777 | 6,000 | 3,777 |
| | = | Maximum compensation | 15,296 | 7,781 | 7,715 | 10,004 | 7,715 |

The base salary and the BSAV contribution (or the amount for free disposal) are fixed amounts. In no case did the fringe benefits awarded to a Managing Board member exceed the maximum amount defined for fiscal 2022. The Bonus cap was not reached in fiscal 2022.

Since the 2022 Stock Awards tranche is not due until November 2025, compliance with the maximum limit of the Stock Awards for fiscal 2022 can be finally assessed only in November 2025, when the 2022 Stock Awards tranche is settled.

The final assessment of compliance with the maximum compensation for fiscal 2022 will be included in the Compensation Report for fiscal 2026.


### B.2.3 Appropriateness of compensation

The Supervisory Board conducted the annual review of Managing Board compensation in order to determine the latter's appropriateness and conformity with market conditions. For this purpose, the Supervisory Board assessed - with the assistance of an external and independent compensation consultant and in accordance with the compensation system - the compensation's level and structure relative to the companies included in the DAX 40, the German blue-chip stock index, and relative to the companies included in the STOXX Europe 50 (horizontal comparison). In the course of its review, the Supervisory Board also assessed the development of Managing Board compensation relative to the compensation of Senior Management and Siemens' total workforce in Germany (vertical comparison). Senior Management comprises executive employees. The total workforce comprises Senior Management as well as the Siemens employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements and those who are not. In addition to a status quo analysis, the vertical comparison took into account the development of compensation ratios over time. Since Siemens Healthineers is a separately managed, publicly listed company, its workforce was not included in the vertical comparison.

<!-- PageFooter="FISCAL 2022 12" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Compensation Report > B. Compensation of Managing Board members" -->

The appropriateness review of Managing Board compensation in fiscal 2022 has shown that Managing Board compensation is appropriate.


## B.3 Variable compensation in fiscal 2022

Variable compensation is tied to performance and accounts for a significant proportion of the total compensation of Managing Board members. It consists of a short-term variable component (Bonus) and a long-term variable component (Stock Awards).

The performance criteria and the key performance indicators used to measure performance for variable compensation in fiscal 2022 are derived from the Company's strategic goals and operational steering and are in line with the current compensation system. As a rule, all the performance criteria measure successful value creation in all its different forms, as strategically envisioned. In line with Siemens' social responsibility, sustainability is also included in the performance criteria.

The performance criteria relevant for fiscal 2022, the key performance indicators, the focus topics and the explanations of how these foster the Company's long-term development are shown in the following table.

Performance criteria of variable compensation and link to strategy

The Supervisory Board aims to ensure that the targets for variable compensation are demanding and sustainable. If they are not reached, variable compensation can be reduced to zero. If the targets are significantly exceeded, target achievement is capped at 200%.


### B.3.1 Short-term variable compensation (Bonus)


#### B.3.1.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES AND FUNCTIONING

The Bonus system is based on three equally weighted target dimensions, which take account of the overall responsibility of the Managing Board as well as each Managing Board members' specific business responsibilities and individual challenges:

\> "Siemens Group"

\> "Managing Board portfolio"

\-> "Individual targets."

Performance criteria are assigned to each of the three target dimensions based on Company priorities and the responsibilities of each Managing Board member. One financial performance criterion is assigned to the "Siemens Group" dimension and another to the "Managing Board portfolio" dimension. The fulfillment of these criteria is measured on the basis of key performance indicators. Within the "Individual targets" dimension, the financial performance criteria "growth" and "liquidity" can be employed as can additional, non-financial performance criteria. In the case of non-financial performance criteria, the Supervisory Board considers the degree to which a Managing Board member has fulfilled so-called focus topics, which comprise operations-related aspects of the execution of the Company's strategy as well as sustainability- related aspects.

At the end of the fiscal year, target achievement for the individual key performance indicators and the achievement of the Managing Board members' individual targets are determined and aggregated to form a weighted average. The percentage of weighted target achievement multiplied by the individual target amount yields the Bonus payout amount for the past fiscal year. The payable Bonus is capped at two times the target amount and is paid in cash, at the latest, together with the compensation paid at the end of February of the following fiscal year.

### B.3.1.2. BONUS FOR FISCAL 2022

"Siemens Group" target dimension

For the "Siemens Group" target dimension in fiscal 2022, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG defined the performance criterion "profit." In accordance with external communications and the Siemens Financial Framework for the financial steering of the Company, the focus is on the transparent presentation of Siemens' operating performance. For this reason, "profit" is measured in terms of basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA). EPS pre PPA is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and related income taxes. It includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG.

To take account of the Company's long-term performance and provide incentives for a sustainable increase in profit, the average EPS pre PPA of three consecutive fiscal years was used for target setting. Because of the significant change in the portfolio of Siemens AG due to the spin-off of Siemens Energy at the end of fiscal 2020, target setting for fiscal 2022 was defined on the basis of the comparable EPS pre PPA values of continuing operations for the fiscal years 2019 and 2020 as well as the EPS pre PPA value for fiscal 2021.

As part of target achievement, the actual EPS pre PPA value of the reporting year is used to ensure that the focus in the reporting year is on performance.

"Managing Board portfolio" target dimension

The Supervisory Board of Siemens AG established "profitability / capital efficiency" measured in terms of return on capital employed (ROCE) as the performance criterion for the "Managing Board portfolio" target dimension for fiscal 2022 for all Managing Board members. ROCE is defined as profit before interest and after tax divided by average capital employed. For the purposes of target setting and determining target achievement, ROCE - as defined in the Siemens Financial Framework, which excludes certain Varian-related acquisition effects - is adjusted for main effects relating to the stake in Siemens Energy (profit "Siemens Energy Investment" in the numerator and asset "Siemens Energy Investment" in the denominator). The target value for ROCE adjusted is derived from budget planning.

As a result of the war in Ukraine, Siemens AG decided to withdraw from the Russian market. This decision was neither foreseeable in budget planning, which is used as a basis for target setting, nor in the actual target setting in November 2021 and was thus not taken into account. In fiscal 2022, the necessary measures resulted in extraordinary charges of €1.3 billion. These charges are reflected in the financial key performance indicators in the Bonus - in particular, in ROCE adjusted - and resulted especially from the divestment and impairment of businesses, the termination of customer contracts and write-downs of assets.

In the case of such unforeseeable extraordinary developments, it is at the discretion of the Supervisory Board whether to take them into account when determining target achievement. In order to acknowledge Siemens' performance in fiscal 2022 and the actual performance of Managing Board members in the context of variable compensation, the Supervisory Board has decided to take into account the effect of the withdrawal from the Russian market when determining the target achievement of ROCE adjusted.

"Individual targets" target dimension

The "Individual targets" target dimension comprises four equally weighted individual targets, achievement of each of which may be between 0% and 200%.

The cash conversion rate (CCR) was defined as the first individual target for all Managing Board members. The CCR reflects a company's ability to convert profit into available cash. For the President and CEO and the Managing Board members with primarily functional responsibility, the CCR target was defined on the basis of the Siemens Group in order to support Siemens' voluntary commitment to generate cash at Group level. CCR Siemens Group is defined as the ratio of free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to net income. For the Managing Board members with business

<!-- PageNumber="16" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Compensation Report > B. Compensation of Managing Board members" -->

responsibility for Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure, the CCR targets are business-specific and defined as the ratio of free cash flow to profit at each business. The target amounts for CCR were based on the budget plans.

In addition to CCR, "comparable revenue growth" was defined as the second individual target for fiscal 2022 for all members of the Managing Board. It indicates the development in Siemens' business net of currency translation effects arising from the external environment outside of Siemens' control and the portfolio effects that involve business activities that are either new to or no longer a part of the relevant business. For the President and CEO and the members of the Managing Board with primarily functional responsibility, the growth target was determined on the basis of continuing operations (c/o) related to the Siemens Group (Siemens c/o). For the Managing Board members with business responsibility for Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure, growth targets are based on their respective businesses. The respective target values were derived from the external outlook for fiscal 2022.

### B.3.2 Long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards)


#### B.3.2.1. BASIC PRINCIPLES AND FUNCTIONING

Siemens grants long-term variable compensation in the form of Stock Awards. A Stock Award is the claim to one share - conditional on target achievement - after the expiration of a defined vesting period. The vesting period is, accordingly, the term of each tranche.

At the beginning of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board defines a target amount in euros based on 100% target achievement for each Managing Board member. This target amount is extrapolated to target achievement of 200% ("maximum allocation amount"). Stock Awards for this maximum allocation amount are then allocated to the Managing Board members. The number of Stock Awards is calculated by dividing the maximum allocation amount by the price of the Siemens share on the allocation date, less the estimated discounted dividends ("allocation price").

An approximately four-year vesting period begins with the allocation of Stock Awards, after the expiration of which Siemens shares are transferred. The beneficiary Managing Board members are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period.


##### Performance criteria

Since fiscal 2020, the number of Siemens shares that is actually transferred depends 80% on the financial performance criterion "long-term value creation," measured on the basis of the key performance indicator "total shareholder return" (TSR), and 20% on the non-financial performance criterion "sustainability." For measuring the "sustainability" performance criterion, Siemens AG's performance in the environment, social and governance (ESG) area is assessed on the basis of a Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index, the composition of which is determined annually by the Supervisory Board.

Total shareholder return - TSR is indicative of the performance of one share over a specified period of time - in the case of Siemens, over the approximately four-year vesting period. It takes into account changes in the share price and the dividends paid during this period. To reflect the Company's international footprint, the TSR of Siemens AG is compared at the end of the vesting period with the TSR of an international sector index, the MSCI World Industrials or a comparable successor index.

Target achievement for TSR is concretely determined by first calculating a TSR reference value for Siemens AG and a TSR reference value for the sector index. The TSR reference value is equal to the average of the end-of-month values over the first 12 months of the vesting period (reference period).

<!-- PageFooter="FISCAL 2022 20" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Compensation Report > B. Compensation of Managing Board members" -->

In order to determine at the end of the vesting period how well the TSR of Siemens AG has performed relative to the TSR of the sector index, the TSR performance value is calculated over the subsequent 36 months (performance period). The TSR performance value is the average of the end-of-month values during the performance period.

At the end of the vesting period, the change in Siemens' TSR as well as that of the sector index is determined by comparing the TSR reference values with the TSR performance values.

Siemens compared to MSCI World Industrials index

· If the change in the TSR of Siemens AG is at least 20 percentage points above that of the sector index, target achievement is 200%.

. If the change in the TSR of Siemens AG is equal to that of the sector index, target achievement is 100%.

. If the change in the TSR of Siemens AG is at least

20 percentage points below that of the sector index, target achievement is 0%.

If the change in the TSR of Siemens AG is between

20 percentage points above and 20 percentage points below that of the sector index, target achievement is calculated using linear interpolation.

Environment, social and governance - The Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is based on three equally weighted, structured and verifiable ESG key performance indicators. At the beginning of each tranche, the Supervisory Board defines the target values for each of the ESG key performance indicators. Target measurement is based on defined interim targets for each fiscal year. Target achievement for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is finally determined at the end of the approximately four-year vesting period on the basis of the weighted average of the target achievement values calculated for each of the key performance indicators.

<!-- PageFooter="FISCAL 2022 21" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Compensation Report > B. Compensation of Managing Board members" -->

Determination of total target achievement

At the end of the approximately four-year vesting period, the Supervisory Board determines the degree of target achievement. The target achievement range for TSR and for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is between 0% and 200%. If target achievement is less than 200%, a number of Siemens Stock Awards equivalent to the shortfall are forfeited without refund or replacement and a correspondingly smaller number of shares is transferred.

The value of the Siemens shares transferred after the expiration of the vesting period is also capped at 300% of the target amount. If this cap is exceeded, a corresponding number of Stock Awards is forfeited without refund or replacement.

The remaining number of Stock Awards is settled by the transfer of Siemens shares to the relevant Managing Board member.

#### B.3.2.2 ALLOCATION OF STOCK AWARDS IN FISCAL 2022

The Supervisory Board approved the following performance criteria for the 2022 Stock Awards tranche:

\> "Long-term value creation," measured in terms of the development of the TSR of Siemens AG relative to the international sector index MSCI World Industrials and

\> "Sustainability," measured in terms of the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index, which is based on the following three equally weighted key performance indicators. Target setting for the three key performance indicators is oriented on the Company's strategic sustainability planning, which is described in detail in Siemens' sustainability reporting.

| CO2 emissions | Digital learning hours per employee | Net Promoter Score (NPS) |
| - | - | - |
| Amount of greenhouse gases emitted by the Company's business operations in tons of CO2 equivalent, excluding carbon offsets (for example, certificates). | The total number of digital learning hours completed in virtual trainer-led training ses- sions, self-paced learning, learning on the job, community-based virtual learning and hybrid training sessions, divided by the total number of employees. | Customer intention to recommend us, measured on a scale of 1 (extremely unlikely) to 10 (extremely likely) and based on comprehensive annual customer satisfaction surveys. The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.1 |

| Sustainability strategy (DEGREE framework) | Sustainability strategy (DEGREE framework) and Company priorities (Growth mindset) | Company priorities (Customer impact) |
| Ambition: | | |
| Net zero operations by 2030 in line with SBTi pathway2 as well as further rein- forcement of Siemens' climate protection strategy by joining the RE100, EV100 and EP100 initiatives in fiscal 2021.3 | Siemens' success is inseparably linked with highly qualified employees. The right employees with the right expertise are decisive for our further growth. That's why we place a strong emphasis on learning in order to sustainably anchor it in our day-to-day working environment while continuously increasing learning hours. | Customer satisfaction is Siemens' top priority. For us, this means identifying customer requirements as early as possible, streng- thening partnerships and maintaining and building trust. As a result, we systematically measure customer satisfaction and take steps to improve it. |

1 Customers that rate Siemens high on the scale are promoters. Customers that find it unlikely to recommend Siemens to others are named detractors. Example: promoters (55%) minus detractors (10%) = NPS (45%).

2 Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi): Reduction targets for 2030 based on the scientific requirements for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

3 Use of renewable energy (RE): 100% green electricity by 2030; use of electric vehicles (EV): 100% electric vehicles; improving energy productivity (EP): 100% CO2-neutral buildings.

The Supervisory Board set the allocation date for the 2022 Stock Awards tranche at November 12, 2021. The time sequence of this tranche is as follows.

1 The fair value on the allocation date is calculated for the TSR component on the basis of a valuation model and amounts to €61.87. The fair value for the ESG component of €135.25 is equal to the Xetra closing price of the Siemens share on the allocation date, less the discounted expected dividends. For the 2022 tranche, the allocation date in accordance with IFRS 2 was November 23, 2021 (the date of communication to the Managing Board members).

2 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, Matthias Rebellius is CEO of Smart Infrastructure and CEO of Siemens Schweiz AG. The correspond- ing legal relationship is defined in a separate contract between Matthias Rebellius and Siemens Schweiz AG. The entire compensation he receives under the terms of his contract with Siemens Schweiz AG is deducted from his Managing Board compensation. Of the target amount reported here (based on 100% target achievement), €600,000 is attributable to Siemens Schweiz AG.

3 At its meeting on December 2, 2021, the Supervisory Board extended the appointment of Chief Financial Officer Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas until December 2026. In connection with this extension, the Supervisory Board approved retroactively an increase in Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas's Stock Awards target amount effective October 1, 2021. This increase was implemented by raising his Stock Awards target amount for the 2022 tranche to €2,000,000 from €1,544,000. Due to the intra-year extension, Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas was not allocated Stock Awards for the increase of €456,000 in his target amount but a corresponding number of virtual Stock Awards (Phantom Stock Awards), in accordance with plan requirements.

Concrete target setting and the degree of target achievement for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index of the 2022 Stock Awards tranche will be published together with the degree of target achievement for the TSR in the Compensation Report for fiscal 2026, after the expiration of the vesting period.


#### B.3.2.3 TRANSFER OF STOCK AWARDS IN FISCAL 2022 (2018 TRANCHE)

The 2018 Stock Awards tranche became due and was settled in fiscal 2022. The 2018 Stock Awards tranche depended on the performance of the Siemens share compared to the share performance of five relevant competitors during the approximately four-year vesting period from November 10, 2017, to November 11, 2021.

1 The Stock Awards settled by share transfer were valued at €147.20, the German low price of the Siemens share on November 12, 2021.

2 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board, Cedrik Neike served as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Siemens Ltd. China from May 1, 2017, to March 31, 2019. Of the allocated number of Stock Awards reported here, 2,500 are attributable to the commitment by Siemens Ltd. China. Of the calculated number of Stock Awards reported here, 2,275 were awarded and paid by Siemens Ltd. China. For the calculation of the additional cash payment resulting from the Siemens Energy spin-off, the Siemens Energy share's Xetra closing price of €24.32 on November 11, 2021, was used, in accordance with the plan requirements applicable to the Managing Board, for the 7,889 Stock Awards awarded by Siemens AG, while the Siemens Energy share's Xetra closing price of €24.45 on November 12, 2021, was used, in accordance with the plan requirements applicable to Senior Management, for the 2,275 Stock Awards awarded by Siemens Ltd. China.

In the course of transferring the 2018 Stock Awards tranche, compliance with the maximum amounts of total compensation for fiscal 2018 was also reviewed. The applicable maximum amount was not exceeded in the case of any Managing Board member.

1 The settlement of Stock Awards from the 2018 tranche was by share transfer up to a target achievement of 100%, and above 100% in cash. For this reason, the number of Stock Awards from the 2018 tranche, as set out in the table, is based on a target achievement of 100%. Starting with the 2019 tranche, settlement of Stock Awards will be entirely by share transfer. For this reason, the number of Stock Awards, as set out in the table, is based on a target achievement of 200%. At the end of the vesting period, a final number of Siemens shares to be transferred will be determined on the basis of actual target achievement and taking into account the Stock Awards cap.

2 The target achievement of the Stock Awards from the 2018 tranche, which were due and settled in fiscal 2022, was 91%. As the Stock Awards from the 2018 tranche were allocated on the basis of 100% target achievement, a number equivalent to this shortfall was forfeited without refund or replacement, in accordance with plan requirements.

3 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board, Cedrik Neike served as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Siemens Ltd. China from May 1, 2017, to March 31, 2019. The reported figures include the Stock Awards allocated to Cedrik Neike by Siemens Ltd. China due to this position.

4 The reported figures also include the Stock Awards allocated to Judith Wiese in November 2020 as compensation for the loss of benefits granted by her former employer in addition to the regular allocation of Stock Awards from the 2021 tranche.

#### B.3.3 Malus and clawback regulations

Under existing malus and clawback regulations, the Supervisory Board is authorized to withhold or reclaim variable compensation in cases of severe breaches of duty or compliance and/or unethical behavior or in cases of grossly negligent or willful breaches of the duty of care or in cases in which variable compensation components linked to the achievement of specific targets have been unduly paid out on the basis of incorrect data.

The Supervisory Board exercises its authority to withhold or reclaim variable compensation components at its duty-bound discretion.

In fiscal 2022, the Supervisory Board did not exercise this authority.

## B.4 Share Ownership Guidelines

The deadlines by which the individual Managing Board members must first verify compliance with the Share Ownership Guidelines (SOG) vary from member to member, depending on when they were appointed to the Managing Board. For Managing Board members in office on September 30, 2022, the following table shows the number of Siemens shares that each held in order to comply with the SOG on March 11, 2022, the verification date. It also shows the number of shares to be held throughout the Managing Board members' terms of office with a view to future verification dates.


### Obligations under the Share Ownership Guidelines

As of March 11, 2022 (verification date).


## B.5 Pension benefit commitment

Most of the members of the Managing Board are included in the Siemens Defined Contribution Pension Plan (BSAV). Since fiscal 2020, newly appointed members of the Managing Board can be awarded, instead of BSAV contributions, a fixed cash amount for free disposal.

Contributions under the BSAV are credited to the individual pension accounts in the January following each fiscal year. Until pension payments begin, members' pension accounts are credited with an annual interest payment (guaranteed interest) on January 1 of each year. The interest rate is currently 0.25%.

2 Deferred compensation for Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas totals €57,419 (2021: €63,478).

Judith Wiese and Matthias Rebellius, who were appointed to the Managing Board as of October 1, 2020, are not included in the BSAV. Instead of BSAV contributions, the Supervisory Board awarded them for fiscal 2022 a fixed cash amount of €550,800 each for free disposal. This amount will be paid in January 2023.

## B.6 Compensation awarded and due


### B.6.1 Active Managing Board members in fiscal 2022

The following tables show the compensation awarded and due to the active members of the Managing Board in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 in accordance with Section 162 para. 1, sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act. As a result, they include all the amounts actually paid to individual Managing Board members in the reporting period ("awarded compensation") and/or all the compensation that is legally due but not yet received ("due compensation").

The Bonus is reported under "Short-term variable compensation" as "due compensation" since the underlying services were fully rendered by the end of each period (September 30). Therefore, the Bonus payout amounts for the reporting year are reported, although payout only occurs after the end of each reporting year, in order to make reporting transparent and comprehensible and in order to guarantee a connection between performance and compensation in the reporting period.

Furthermore, in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, the Stock Awards from the 2018 and 2017 tranches allocated in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, became due and were settled by transfer of Siemens shares. The value of Siemens shares at the time of transfer is reported under "Long-term variable compensation."

In connection with the due date and settlement of the Stock Awards for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the table also includes the additional cash payments to eligible Managing Board members as a result of the Siemens Energy spin-off. The spin-off of Siemens Energy in fiscal 2020 led to adjustments in the stock-based compensation allocations agreed upon until the spin-off date. At the time when the 2018 and 2017 Stock Awards became due, the Managing Board members - like all other eligible employees - were, accordingly, entitled to receive an additional cash payment based on the spin-off ratio of 2:1 and on the Siemens Energy share price of €24.32 and €22.20, respectively, on the date when their respective stock- based compensation allocations became due.

In addition to the amounts of compensation, Section 162 para. 1 sent. 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act requires disclosure of the relative proportion of total compensation represented by all fixed and variable compensation components. The relative proportions reported here refer to the compensation components "awarded" and "due" in the respective fiscal years in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act.

Although the service costs for Company pension plans are not to be classified as awarded and due compensation, they are also reported in the following table for purposes of transparency.

1 Matthias Rebellius and Judith Wiese are not included in the Siemens Defined Contribution Pension Plan (BSAV). Instead of BSAV contributions, they receive a fixed cash amount for free disposal.

2 Dr. Roland Busch was first appointed a full member of the Managing Board effective April 1, 2011. He served as Deputy CEO from October 1, 2019, until the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 3, 2021, when he succeeded Joe Kaeser as President and CEO.

3 Cedrik Neike was appointed a full member of the Managing Board effective April 1, 2017. Due to his intra-year appointment, his Stock Awards target amount for fiscal 2017 was determined on a pro-rated basis and, instead of Stock Awards, a corresponding number of Phantom Stock Awards was allocated to him in accordance with plan requirements. In contrast to Stock Awards, these Phantom Stock Awards were settled after the expiration of the vesting period by cash payment rather than by share transfer.

4 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board, Cedrik Neike served as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Siemens Ltd. China from May 1, 2017, to March 31, 2019. The amounts reported under "2018 Stock Awards (vesting: 2017 - 2021)" and "2017 Stock Awards (vesting: 2016 - 2020)" include the value of the Stock Awards allo- cated by Siemens Ltd. China. Likewise, a portion of the additional cash payment attributable to the Stock Awards allocated by Siemens Ltd. China is included under "Cash payment Siemens Energy spin-off." For details, see chapter "B.3.2.3 Transfer of Stock Awards in fiscal 2022 (2018 tranche)."

5 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, Matthias Rebellius is CEO of Smart Infrastructure and CEO of Siemens Schweiz AG. The correspond- ing legal relationship is defined in a separate contract between Matthias Rebellius and Siemens Schweiz AG. The entire compensation he receives under the terms of his contract with Siemens Schweiz AG is deducted from his Managing Board compensation. Of the base salary and fringe benefits reported here, €647,749 and €32,551, respectively, were awarded and paid by Siemens Schweiz AG. Of the Bonus for fiscal 2022 reported here, €812,915 (corresponding to CHF 777,228 and converted into euros as of September 30, 2022) will be paid by Siemens Schweiz AG. Furthermore, employer contributions to pension plans paid by Siemens Schweiz AG are deducted from the amount for free disposal.

C. Compensation of Supervisory Board members
===

The currently applicable rules for Supervisory Board compensation are set out in Section 17 of the Articles of Association of Siemens AG. They have been in effect since October 1, 2021, and stem from a decision of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 3, 2021, in accordance with Section 113 para. 3 of the German Stock Corporation Act. The compensation system for Supervisory Board members submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and the proposed new version of Section 17 of the Articles of Association were approved by a majority of 97.49% of the valid votes cast. The compensation system approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting as well as the Articles of Association are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE.

Supervisory Board compensation consists entirely of fixed compensation; it reflects the responsibilities and scope of the work of the Supervisory Board members. Under the applicable rules, the members of the Supervisory Board receive base compensation for each full fiscal year, and the members of the Audit Committee, the Chairman's Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Innovation and Finance Committee receive additional compensation for their committee work. The Chairman and Deputy Chairs of the Supervisory Board as well as the chairs of the Audit Committee, the Chairman's Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Innovation and Finance Committee receive additional compensation.

| €90,000 | €40,000 | €40,000 | €40,000 |

In the event of changes in the composition of the Supervisory Board and/or its committees within a fiscal year, compensation is paid on a pro-rated basis, rounding up to the next full month.

In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board receive a fee of €2,000 for each of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees that they attend. Attendance at a meeting also includes participation via telephone, video conference or other similar customary means of communication. For attendance at several meetings on the same day, only a single fee is paid.

The members of the Supervisory Board are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their duties and for any value-added tax to be paid on their compensation. For the performance of his duties, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is also entitled to an office with secretarial support and the use of a car service. No loans or advances from the Company are provided to members of the Supervisory Board.

D. Comparative information on profit development and annual change in compensation
===

The following table shows, in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 2 No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act, Siemens' profit development, the annual change in the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members' compensation and the annual change in average employee compensation on a full-time equivalent basis over the last five fiscal years.

Profit development is presented on the basis of the Siemens Group's key performance indicators revenue, comparable revenue growth and basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations. Through fiscal 2021, the latter was also one of the financial targets for the short-term variable compensation (Bonus) of the Managing Board and thus had a significant influence on the amount of the compensation of the Managing Board members. Beginning in fiscal 2022, the comparative information will also include basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation. This key performance indicator supersedes basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations in the Bonus in accordance with the Siemens Financial Framework, which has been in effect since fiscal 2022. In accordance with Section 275 para. 3 No. 16 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB), the development of the net income of Siemens AG is also shown.

The compensation awarded and due to the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members in each fiscal year is presented in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act. Pension payments to former members of the Managing Board are not listed here since they do not depend on Siemens' profit development.

The presentation of average employee compensation is based on the size of the workforce, including trainees, employed by Siemens in Germany. In fiscal 2022, this workforce comprised on average 69,767 employees (full-time equivalent). By way of comparison, the Siemens Group had about 247,000 employees and trainees worldwide as of September 30, 2022. The figures exclude the workforce of Siemens Healthineers, which is not included in the presentation since it is a separately managed, publicly listed company.

Average employee compensation comprises the personnel costs for wages and salaries, fringe benefits, employer contributions to social insurance and any short-term variable compensation components attributable to the fiscal year. For compensation in connection with share plans, the amounts received in the fiscal year are taken into account. Therefore, employee compensation is also equivalent, in principle, to awarded and due compensation within the meaning of Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act and thus in line with Managing Board and Supervisory Board compensation.

1 Revenue as reported. In fiscal 2020, the segments "Gas and Power" and "Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy" were classified as discontinued operations and are therefore not included in the amount reported for fiscal 2020.

2 The primary measure for managing and controlling revenue growth is comparable growth, because it shows the development in Siemens' business net of currency translation effects arising from the external environment outside of Siemens' control and the portfolio effects that involve business activities that are either new to or no longer a part of the relevant business.

3 Basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations as reported.

4 The increase in compensation in fiscal 2019 is primarily attributable to the one-time benefit from two Stock Awards tranches - the 2014 and 2015 tranches - in November 2018, due to a reduction in the duration of the Stock Awards to the customary four-year period starting with the 2015 tranche.

Independent auditor's report
===


## To Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich

We have audited the attached Compensation Report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich, prepared to comply with Sec. 162 AktG ["Aktiengesetz": German Stock Corporation Act] for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 and the related disclosures. We have not audited the content of disclosures regarding appropriateness and marketability of the compensation in chapter B.2.3 APPROPRIATENESS OF COMPENSATION that is beyond the scope of Sec. 162 AktG.


### Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board

Management and the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG are responsible for the preparation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures in compliance with the requirements of Sec. 162 AktG. In addition, management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a Compensation Report and the related disclosures that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.


#### Auditor's responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this Compensation Report and the related disclosures based on our audit. We conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Compensation Report and the related disclosures are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts in the Compensation Report and the related disclosures. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures in order to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the Supervisory Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.


##### Opinion

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the Compensation Report for the fiscal year from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 and the related disclosures comply, in all material respects, with the financial reporting provisions of Sec. 162 AktG. Our opinion on the Compensation Report does not cover the content of the above mentioned disclosures of the Compensation Report that go beyond the scope of Sec. 162 AktG.


###### Other matter - formal audit of the Compensation Report

The audit of the content of the Compensation Report described in this auditor's report comprises the formal audit of the Compensation Report required by Sec. 162 (3) AktG and the issue of a report on this audit. As we are issuing an unqualified opinion on the audit of the content of the Compensation Report, this also includes the opinion that the disclosures pursuant to Sec. 162 (1) and (2) AktG are made in the Compensation Report in all material respects.

<!-- PageHeader="Compensation Report > Independent auditor's report" -->


###### Limitation of liability

The "General Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftsprüfer and Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaften [German Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms]" as issued by the IDW on January 1, 2017, are applicable to this engagement and also govern our responsibility and liability to third parties in the context of this engagement (WWW.DE.EY.COM/GENERAL-ENGAGEMENT- TERMS).

Report of the Supervisory Board
===

Berlin and Munich, December 7, 2022


## Dear Shareholders,

In fiscal 2022, Siemens AG accelerated growth, gained market share in its key markets and created ground- breaking innovations. These achievements were par- ticularly striking in view of the major disruptions that took place during the year - above all, Russia's war against Ukraine and the geopolitical, energy-related and economic distortions that it entailed. Siemens strongly condemned this war, while demonstrating its ability to deal with the resulting disruptions. The Company's inno- vative, sustainability-focused portfolio proved to be a reliable, future-oriented basis for business success.

The new image of Siemens that the Supervisory Board and the Managing Board are pursuing consistently and in close cooperation is gaining ever-wider recognition - the image of a globally successful technology company focused on industry, infrastructure, transport and health- care with strong business models in the areas of digitali- zation and sustainability.

Against this backdrop, technology and sustainability were key focal topics of the Supervisory Board's work in fiscal 2022. In the area of technology, the launch of Siemens Xcelerator - an open, digital business platform for accelerating the digital transformation of the global economy - is a particular highlight. The steps to imple- ment this groundbreaking project were continuously discussed by the Managing and Supervisory Boards. In the area of sustainability, the Supervisory Board paid particular attention to the further development of busi- ness models: effective solutions that cut CO2 emissions, reduce resource utilization and are indispensable for advanced economies. These solutions are becoming a centerpiece of successful business activity - both at Siemens and far beyond. In addition, the Supervisory Board intensively monitored the further development of DEGREE, Siemens' sustainability framework.

In fiscal 2022, the Supervisory Board performed in full the duties assigned to it by law, the Siemens Articles of Asso- ciation and the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board. On the basis of detailed written and oral reports provided by the Managing Board, we monitored the Managing Board and advised it on the management of the Company. In my capacity as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, I regu- larly exchanged information with the President and CEO and the other Managing Board members. As a result, the Supervisory Board was always kept up to date on pro- jected business policies, Company planning - including financial, investment and personnel planning - and the Company's profitability and business operations as well as on the state of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group. We were directly involved at an early stage in all decisions of fundamental importance to the Company and dis- cussed these decisions with the Managing Board inten- sively and in detail. To the extent that Supervisory Board approval of the decisions and measures of Company management was required by law, the Siemens Articles of Association or our Bylaws, the members of the Super- visory Board - prepared in some cases by the Supervisory Board's committees - issued such approval after inten- sive review and discussion.

A special focus of our activities in fiscal 2022 was the fur- ther implementation of the Company's growth strategy. At our meetings and in additional informational sessions, we concerned ourselves intensively with the goals and priorities of Siemens' businesses and with the Managing Board's technology and personnel strategy. In this con- nection, we focused our attention on the accelerated transformation toward digitalization, sustainability and business and technological innovation and on the related opportunities for growth. Together with the Managing Board, we discussed markets, trends and growth fields. An additional focus of our activities in fiscal 2022 was Siemens AG's sustainability strategy. We concerned our- selves with sustainability-related topics in the environ- mental, social and governance (ESG) area. At the center

<!-- PageHeader="Report of the Supervisory Board" -->

was DEGREE, our Companywide sustainability frame- work, with its aspects decarbonization, ethics, gover- nance, resource efficiency, equity and employability. The Supervisory Board discussed the risks and opportunities for the Company connected with social and environmen- tal factors as well as the environmental and social impact of the Company's activities. The Supervisory Board also concerned itself with the 2021 Sustainability Report.


## Topics at the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board

We held a total of six regular plenary meetings in fiscal 2022. Two meetings were held in person, two in a virtual format via video conference and two in a so-called hybrid format - that is, as in-person meetings with the pos- sibility of virtual participation. No meetings were held via telephone conference. We also made four decisions using other customary means of communication. Topics of dis- cussion at our regular plenary meetings were revenue, profit and employment development at Siemens AG and the Siemens Group, the Company's financial position and the results of its operations, personnel-related matters and sustainability. In addition, we concerned ourselves, as oc- casion required, with acquisition and divestment projects and with risks to the Company. We received regular reports from the Managing Board regarding the political and eco- nomic consequences of the war in Ukraine, its impact on Siemens and the impact on Siemens of the COVID-19 pan- demic. In this connection, we discussed, in particular, the risk of bottlenecks in the supply chain. In addition, we met regularly in closed sessions without the Managing Board in attendance. In these sessions, we dealt with agenda items that concerned either the Managing Board itself or internal Supervisory Board matters.

On October 15, 2021, the Supervisory approved - in a decision using other customary means of communi- cation - the Managing Board's preliminary decision re- garding the holding of the 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meeting in a virtual format.

At our meeting on November 10, 2021, we discussed the key financial figures for fiscal 2021 and approved the budget for fiscal 2022. On a recommendation by the Compensation Committee, we also defined the Manag- ing Board members' compensation for fiscal 2021 on the basis of calculated target achievement. A review con- ducted by an external compensation expert confirmed

the appropriateness of this compensation. We had al- ready defined the performance criteria for the Managing Board's variable compensation for fiscal 2022 at our meeting on September 22, 2021. On this basis and on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, we made a decision on target setting for Managing Board compensation for fiscal 2022 at our meeting on Novem- ber 10, 2021. At this meeting, we also approved the Corporate Governance Statement for fiscal 2021.

On December 2, 2021, we discussed the 2021 Annual Financial Report - comprising the financial statements and the Combined Management Report for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group as of September 30, 2021 - as well as the Report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Sustainability Report, the Com- pensation Report for fiscal 2021 and the agenda for the ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 10, 2022. In addition, we concerned ourselves with the annual reporting by the Chief Compliance Officer and the Global Chief Cybersecurity Officer. As part of a technology focus, the Managing Board reported on the status of Siemens Xcelerator, the Company's open digital busi- ness platform for accelerating the digital transformation. We also concerned ourselves with personnel-related matters regarding the Managing Board. With a view to the long-term succession planning for the composition of the Managing Board, we decided - on the recommen- dation of the Chairman's Committee - to terminate Prof. Dr. Ralf Thomas's current appointment by mutual consent, effective the end of December 14, 2021, and to reappoint Prof. Dr. Ralf Thomas a full member of the Managing Board for a term of office extending from December 15, 2021, through December 14, 2026.

On January 17, 2022, we approved - in a decision using other customary means of communication - the Manag- ing Board's decision to sell the Yunex Traffic road traffic business to Atlantia S.p.A.

At our meeting on February 9, 2022, the Managing Board reported on the Company's current business and financial position, including personnel-related matters and sus- tainability, as of the first quarter. We also discussed port- folio optimization in order to further sharpen Siemens' profile as a focused technology company. We approved the Managing Board's decisions to sell the mail and parcel business of Siemens Logistics to the Körber Group and to

<!-- PageFooter="FISCAL 2022 3" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Report of the Supervisory Board" -->

sell the Company's 50% stake in the joint venture Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH to Valeo GmbH. On February 25, 2022, we made a decision - using other cus- tomary means of communication - regarding the engage- ment of an external consultant to support the Supervisory Board in conducting its self-assessment as recommended by the German Corporate Governance Code.

At our meeting on May 11, 2022, the Managing Board reported to us on the Company's current business and financial position, including personnel-related matters and sustainability, as of the second quarter. The focus was on the political and economic consequences of the war in Ukraine and on the war's impact on Siemens. The Manag- ing Board informed us about its decision, as a result of the war in Ukraine, to withdraw from the Russian market and to wind down the Company's industrial business activi- ties in Russia through an orderly process. As part of a stra- tegic and technology focus, we concerned ourselves at this meeting extensively and in detail with the growth targets and the further implementation of Siemens' strat- egy as a focused technology company. We discussed the market and business situation and the Company's strat- egy for China. The Managing Board informed us about the planned market launch of Siemens Xcelerator, the Company's open digital business platform, and reported on the business situation at Siemens Financial Services. We were also informed about the planned acquisition of Brightly Software, Inc., USA, a leading U.S. software-as-a- service (SaaS) provider in the area of building technology. On June 23, 2022, we approved - in a decision using other customary means of communication - the Managing Board's decision regarding this acquisition.

On June 30, 2022, we were informed about the publi- cation of an ad hoc announcement in which Siemens AG reported an extraordinary write-down of its at-equity investment in Siemens Energy AG.

At our meeting on August 10, 2022, the Managing Board reported on the Company's current business and finan- cial position and on personnel-related matters, as of the third quarter. The Managing Board explained to us, in particular, the unscheduled write-down of the Company's investment in Siemens Energy AG, which was published in an ad hoc announcement, and the resulting nontax- deductible impairment in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Sustainability-related topics were also a focus of the meeting. We dealt with the Company's sustainability

strategy as well as the Companywide DEGREE sustainabil- ity framework. We discussed the Company's business opportunities connected with sustainability-related fac- tors and concerned ourselves with business potential particularly in the areas of decarbonization, energy effi- ciency and resource efficiency. We also discussed the re- quirements of the EU Taxonomy and their impact on Siemens. With regard to Siemens Healthineers, we were informed about progress in the integration of Varian. We discussed the business situation and the Managing Board's deliberations in the area of Large Drives Applica- tions. We approved the Managing Board's decision to sell Siemens Financial Services' leasing business in Russia. As part of regular reporting on the activities of the Supervisory Board committees, we were informed that the Audit Committee had decided - following a compre- hensive tendering process in accordance with the current European legal norms - to propose that the Super- visory Board recommend to shareholders at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2024 two audit firms - Price- waterhouseCoopers GmbH, Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesell- schaft, Frankfurt a. M., and KPMG AG, Wirtschafts- prüfungsgesellschaft, München, with a preference for PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH - as independent audi- tors for the tendered audit mandate for the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2023. We discussed the results of the Supervisory Board's comprehensive self-assess- ment, which had been conducted in May through July 2022 with the support of an external consultant, and the resulting recommendations and measures. Finally, we made a decision regarding the engagement of an independent compensation expert to conduct an appro- priateness review of Managing Board compensation in fiscal 2022.

The Supervisory Board meeting on September 23, 2022, was held at the Company's locomotive plant in Munich-Allach, Germany. While touring the facility, we familiarized ourselves with the advanced production methods at the longstanding location and had products for freight and passenger transport and the modular and adaptable approach to manufacturing explained to us. At the meeting, the Managing Board reported on the state of the Company. The Company's personnel strategy - in- cluding talent and leadership development, long-term succession planning for the composition of the Managing Board and diversity - was also a focus of this meeting. We discussed the Managing Board's considerations regarding the 2023 budget. In connection with Siemens' strategy,

<!-- PageNumber="FISCAL 2022 4" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Report of the Supervisory Board" -->

the Managing Board reported to us on the successful market launch of Siemens Xcelerator, the Company's open digital business platform. Under the heading "Future of Industrial Operations," the Managing Board reported to us - as part of an in-depth focus - on Digital Industries' strategic approach to the acceleration of the digital transformation. In light of the changes in market conditions due to digitalization and the change in cus- tomer behavior, the Managing Board also reported to us on the transformation of the Company's sales activities. We approved the Managing Board's decision regarding the Facility Siemensstadt Square Project in Berlin, Ger- many. A further focus of the meeting was Managing Board compensation. A review by an independent com- pensation expert confirmed the appropriateness of this compensation in fiscal 2022. As part of the annual review of Managing Board compensation and - after prepara- tion by and on a recommendation of the Compensation Committee - we defined each Managing Board mem- ber's individual target total compensation and maximum compensation as well as the performance criteria for vari- able compensation for fiscal 2023. At this meeting, we also made a decision regarding the engagement of an auditor for the Compensation Report for fiscal 2022. In addition, we dealt with matters relating to corporate gov- ernance, in particular, with the Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code. Due to changes in the legal requirements and the reform of the German Corporate Governance Code in 2022, we ap- proved changes to the diversity concept for the Manag- ing Board and to the objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board as well as the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Supervi- sory Board. We concerned ourselves with the indepen- dence of the Supervisory Board members within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code and with the qualification matrix for the Supervisory Board.


## Corporate Governance Code

At our meeting on September 23, 2022, we approved a Declaration of Conformity in accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG). Information on corporate governance is provided in the Corporate Governance Statement, which is publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at [ www. :unselected: SIEMENS.COM/CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE. The Company's Dec- laration of Conformity has been made permanently avail- able to shareholders on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/DECLARATIONOFCONFORMITY. The current :unselected: Declaration of Conformity is also available in the Corpo- rate Governance Statement.


## Work in the Supervisory Board committees

In fiscal 2022, the Supervisory Board had six standing committees. These committees prepare proposals and issues to be dealt with at the Supervisory Board's plenary meetings. Some of the Supervisory Board's decision-mak- ing powers have been delegated to these committees within the permissible legal framework. The committee chairpersons report to the Supervisory Board on their committees' work at the subsequent Board meeting. A list of the members and a detailed explanation of the tasks of the individual Supervisory Board committees are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement.

The Chairman's Committee met eight times. Two meet- ings were held in person, four in a virtual format via video conference and two in a so-called hybrid format. The Chairman's Committee also made two decisions using other customary means of communication. In my capac- ity as Chairman of the Chairman's Committee, I discussed topics of major importance with the other Committee members also between meetings. The Committee con- cerned itself, in particular, with personnel-related mat- ters, long-term succession planning for the composition of the Managing Board, corporate governance issues and the acceptance by Managing Board members of positions at other companies and institutions.

<!-- PageNumber="FISCAL 2022 5" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Report of the Supervisory Board" -->

The Nominating Committee met seven times. One meeting was held in person, three in a virtual format via video conference and three in a so-called hybrid format. The Nominating Committee gave in-depth consideration to succession planning for the composition of the Supervisory Board. Based on the results of the Super- visory Board's self-assessment, which was conducted in fiscal 2022, the Nominating Committee further devel- oped the qualification matrix for the Supervisory Board. One focus of the Nominating Committee's activities in fiscal 2022 was the preparation of the Supervisory Board's nominations of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board for election by the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Nominating Committee was supported in this connection by an external consulting firm. In selecting the potential candidates and in pre- paring a recommendation for the Supervisory Board decision, the Nominating Committee gave particular con- sideration to the objectives that the Supervisory Board had previously approved for its composition, including the profile of required skills and expertise, the diversity concept and the further developed qualification matrix for the Supervisory Board.


### The Mediation Committee had no need to meet.

The Compensation Committee met three times. All three meetings were held in person. The Compensation Committee also made two decisions using other custom- ary means of communication. The Compensation Com- mittee prepared, in particular, Supervisory Board deci- sions regarding the definition of performance criteria and the targets for variable compensation, the determination and review of the appropriateness of Managing Board compensation and the approval of the Compensation Report. In addition, the Compensation Committee pre- pared the Supervisory Board's decision regarding the engagement of an auditor for the Compensation Report for fiscal 2022.

The Innovation and Finance Committee met two times. One meeting was held in person and one in a so-called hybrid format. The Innovation and Finance Committee's work focused on innovation- and technology-related top- ics. The Innovation and Finance Committee discussed the Company's strategic priorities, technologies and growth opportunities relating to the industrial metaverse. Under the heading "UX Transformation," the Managing Board reported on progress in user-centered product design.

The Innovation and Finance Committee also concerned itself with Next47, the independent unit established by Siemens in 2016 to bundle the Company's venture capital activities in order to foster disruptive ideas more inten- sively and expedite the development of new technolo- gies. In addition, the Committee's meetings focused on the discussion of the pension system and the preparation and approval of investment and divestment projects and/or financial measures. The Innovation and Finance Committee approved the Managing Board's decision re- garding the Siemens Campus Erlangen Project.

The Audit Committee held six regular meetings. Three meetings were held in person, one in a virtual format via video conference and two in a so-called hybrid format. In the presence of the independent auditors, the President and CEO, the Chief Financial Officer, the General Coun- sel, the Head of Accounting and the Head of Corporate Audit, the Audit Committee dealt with the financial state- ments and the Combined Management Report for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group, including the non-financial information integrated into the Combined Management Report. It discussed the Half-year Financial Report and the quarterly statements with the Managing Board and the independent auditors. In the presence of the independent auditors, it also discussed the report on the auditors' review of the Company's Half-year Consoli- dated Financial Statements and of its Interim Group Man- agement Report. As part of the preparation and imple- mentation of the audit, the Audit Committee regularly exchanged views with the independent auditors without the Managing Board in attendance. In addition, it met regularly in closed sessions without the Managing Board and the independent auditors in attendance. Outside its meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee regu- larly exchanged views with the independent auditors re- garding the progress of the audit and reported to the Audit Committee thereon. The Audit Committee recom- mended that the Supervisory Board propose to the An- nual Shareholders' Meeting that Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, be elected independent auditors for fiscal 2022. It awarded the audit contract for fiscal 2022 to the independent auditors, who had been elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, defined the audit's focus areas and determined the audi- tors' fee. The Audit Committee defined the audit plan and the Audit Committee's focus areas. It monitored the se- lection, independence, qualification, rotation and effi- ciency of the independent auditors as well as the services

<!-- PageNumber="FISCAL 2022 6" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Report of the Supervisory Board" -->

they provided and concerned itself with the review of the quality of the audit of the financial statements. In fiscal 2022, against the backdrop of the Wirecard situa- tion, the Audit Committee regularly discussed the role of Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, as the independent auditors of Wirecard AG. The Audit Committee questioned the independent audi- tors regarding this matter and assessed the impact on Siemens AG. No impediments were identified that would preclude Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- gesellschaft, Stuttgart, from being elected to serve as independent auditors for fiscal 2023. The Audit Commit- tee also dealt with the Company's accounting and ac- counting process, the appropriateness and effectiveness of its internal control system and its risk management system (including sustainability-related aspects), and the effectiveness, resources and findings of its internal audit as well as with reports concerning potential and pending legal disputes. In addition, the Audit Committee con- cerned itself with the Company's compliance with legal requirements, official regulations and the Company's internal guidelines (compliance) and dealt, in particular, with the quarterly reports, the Chief Compliance Offi- cer's annual report and the compliance management system. For this topic, the Managing Board member re- sponsible for People & Organization also attended the Audit Committee meetings at the invitation of the Audit Committee Chairman. The Audit Committee concerned itself with the new German Supply Chain Act (Lieferketten- sorgfaltspflichtengesetz, LkSG). It also focused on the current and future regulatory requirements regarding sustainability reporting and its implementation, includ- ing, in particular, the requirements of the EU Taxonomy. Due to the regular external rotation of independent audi- tors at the conclusion of fiscal 2023 required in accor- dance with the current legal situation, the Audit Commit- tee's work in fiscal 2022 also focused on the preparation and implementation of a transparent and non-discrimi- natory process for the selection of the independent audi- tors for fiscal 2024. At its meeting on August 3, 2021, the Audit Committee had already approved for this purpose the introduction of a tendering process in accordance with Article 16 of the EU audit regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16, 2014, on specific requirements regarding the

statutory audit of public-interest entities and repealing Commission Decision 2005/909/EG, "EU audit regula- tion"). After a thorough review of the applicants, the Audit Committee decided to propose to the Supervisory Board two audit firms - PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH, Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt a. M., and KPMG AG, Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, München, with a preference for PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH - as independent auditors for the tendered audit mandate for the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2023.

The Supervisory Board members take part, on their own responsibility, in the educational and training measures necessary for the performance of their duties - measures relating, for example, to changes in the legal framework and new, groundbreaking technologies. The Company supports them in this regard. Internal informational events are offered when necessary to support targeted training measures. In fiscal 2022, two internal training events concerning strategically relevant technology- related topics were held for all Supervisory Board mem- bers: one on March 30, 2022, and one on April 12, 2022.

New Supervisory Board members can meet with Manag- ing Board members and other managers with specialist responsibility to exchange views on current topics and topics of fundamental importance and thus gain an over- view of Company-relevant matters (onboarding). There was no need for such informational events in fiscal 2022 since the Supervisory Board's composition did not change over the course of the year.


## Disclosure of participation by individual Supervisory Board members in meetings

The average rate of participation by members in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees was 98%. Due to the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, all meetings in fiscal 2022 were held not only in person but also in a virtual format via video conference or as in-person meetings in which virtual participation was also possible (so-called hybrid meetings). No meetings were held via telephone confer- ence. The participation rate of individual members in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees is set out in the following chart:

## Detailed discussion of the audit of the financial statements

The independent auditors, Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, audited the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG, the Consol- idated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group and the Combined Management Report for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group for fiscal 2022 and issued an unqual- ified opinion for each. Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschafts- prüfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, has served as the inde- pendent auditors of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group since fiscal 2009. Katharina Breitsameter has signed as auditor since fiscal 2016 and as auditor responsible for the audit since fiscal 2021. Dr. Philipp Gaenslen has signed as auditor since fiscal 2021. The Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG and the Combined Manage- ment Report for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group

were prepared in accordance with the requirements of German law. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German law set out in Section 315 e (1) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). The Con- solidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group also comply with the IFRS as issued by the International Ac- counting Standards Board (IASB). The independent audi- tors conducted their audit in accordance with Section 317 of the German Commercial Code and the EU Audit Regu- lation and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements as promulgated by the Insti- tut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) as well as in supplemen- tary compliance with the International Standards on Au- diting (ISA). The abovementioned documents as well as

<!-- PageNumber="FISCAL 2022 8" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Report of the Supervisory Board" -->

the Managing Board's proposal for the appropriation of net income were submitted to us by the Managing Board in advance. The Audit Committee discussed the dividend proposal in detail at its meeting on November 15, 2022. It discussed the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group and the Combined Management Report in detail at its meeting on December 6, 2022. In this context, the Audit Committee concerned itself, in particular, with the key audit matters described in the independent auditors' respective opinions, including the audit procedures implemented. The Audit Committee's review also covered the non-financial information for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group that is included in the Combined Management Report, including the infor- mation regarding the EU Taxonomy. The audit reports prepared by the independent auditors were distributed to all members of the Supervisory Board and compre- hensively reviewed at the Supervisory Board meeting on December 7, 2022, in the presence of the independent auditors, who reported on the scope, focal points and main findings of their audit, addressing, in particular, key audit matters, the Audit Committee's focus areas and the audit procedures implemented. No major weak- nesses in the Company's internal control or risk manage- ment systems were reported. At this meeting, the Managing Board explained the financial statements of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group as well as the Company's risk management system.

The Supervisory Board concurs with the results of the audit. Following the definitive findings of the Audit Committee's examination and our own examination, we have no objections. The Managing Board prepared the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group. We approved the Annual Financial Statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements. In view of our approval, the financial statements are accepted as sub- mitted. We endorsed the Managing Board's proposal that the net income available for distribution be used to pay out a dividend of €4.25 per share entitled to a dividend and that the amount of net income attributable to shares of stock not entitled to receive a dividend for fiscal 2022 be carried forward.

The Sustainability Report for fiscal 2022, the information regarding the EU Taxonomy in the Combined Manage- ment Report for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group for fiscal 2022 and the independent auditors' related reports were dealt with at the Audit Committee meeting on December 6, 2022, and at the Supervisory Board meeting on December 7, 2022.


## Changes in the composition of the Supervisory and Managing Boards

There were no changes in the composition of the Manag- ing Board or the Supervisory Board in fiscal 2022.

By a decision of the Supervisory Board on November 16, 2022, the appointment of Judith Wiese as a full member of the Managing Board was extended from October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2028.

On behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the members of the Managing Board and all the employ- ees and employee representatives of Siemens AG and of all Group companies for their outstanding commitment and constructive cooperation in fiscal 2022.

As of today, Siemens AG complies with and will con- tinue to comply with all the recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code in the version of April 28, 2022, published by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official section of the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger), with the following exception:

\-> Siemens AG does not comply with the recommen- dation in C.10 sent. 1 variant 3. According to this recommendation, the chair of the committee that addresses Managing Board compensation shall be

independent from the company and the Managing Board.

As of October 1, 2021, the date of its last Declaration of Conformity, Siemens AG complied with all the recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code in the ver- sion of December 16, 2019, published by the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection in the official section of the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger), with the following exceptions:

\-> Siemens AG did not comply with the recommenda- tion in B.3. According to this recommendation, the first-time appointment of Managing Board members shall be for a period of not more than three years.

\-> Siemens AG did not comply with the recommenda- tions in C.4 and C.5. According to the recommenda- tion in C.4, a Supervisory Board member who is not a member of any Managing Board of a listed company shall not accept more than five Supervisory Board mandates at non-group listed companies or compa- rable functions, with an appointment as chair of the Supervisory Board being counted twice. According to the recommendation in C.5, members of the Manag- ing Board of a listed company shall not have, in aggre- gate, more than two Supervisory Board mandates in non-group listed companies or comparable functions and shall not accept the chairmanship of a Super- visory Board in a non-group listed company.

\-> Siemens AG did not comply with the recommenda- tion in C.10 sent. 1 variant 3. According to this recom- mendation, the chair of the committee that addresses Managing Board compensation shall be independent from the company and the Managing Board.

Following the regular departure of Werner Wenning, the previous, long-serving Chairman of the Compensa- tion Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG, from the Supervisory Board and thereby also from the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Com- mittee elected Michael Diekmann to serve as its new

<!-- PageNumber="2" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Corporate Governance Statement" -->

Chairman, effective February 4, 2021. Mr. Diekmann has been a member of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG since January 24, 2008, and is therefore not regarded as independent in terms of the Code's in- dependence indicators. In the view of the Compensa- tion Committee, however, Mr. Diekmann is currently the most suitable candidate for the position of Chair- man because of his professional experience - due, among other things, to his many years of work on the Compensation Committee - and because his election will help ensure continuity in the Committee's work.

The previous deviations from the recommendations in B.3, C.4 and C.5 were explained as follows:

Instead of regarding the recommended maximum pe- riod of the first-time appointment of Managing Board members and the recommended maximum number of mandates for Managing Board and Supervisory Board members as rigid upper limits, an assessment is to be possible in each individual case. While the period of the first-time appointment of a Managing Board member shall not, as a rule, exceed three years, an assessment is to be possible in each individual case in order to de- termine what period of appointment is deemed appro- priate within the legally permissible period. This assess- ment is to consider the individual qualifications and experience of the Managing Board member to be ap- pointed and, in particular, the qualifications and expe- rience that he or she has acquired over many years in management positions within the Siemens Group. With regard to the number of mandates accepted by Manag- ing Board and Supervisory Board members, an assess- ment is also to be possible in each individual case in order to determine if the number of accepted mandates relevant within the meaning of the Code is deemed ap- propriate. This assessment is to consider the expected personal workload caused by the accepted mandates, which can vary from mandate to mandate.

## 3\. Information on corporate governance practices


## Suggestions of the Code

Siemens AG voluntarily complies with the Code's sugges- tions, with only the following exception:

According to the suggestion in A.8 of the Code, in the case of a takeover event, the Managing Board should convene an Extraordinary General Meeting at which shareholders will discuss the takeover offer and may de- cide on corporate actions. The convening of a share- holders' meeting - even taking into account the short- ened time limits stipulated in the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz, WpÜG) - is an organizational chal- lenge for large publicly listed companies. It appears doubtful whether the associated effort is justified also in cases where no relevant decisions by the shareholders' meeting are intended. Therefore, extraordinary share- holders' meetings shall be convened only in appropriate cases.

Further corporate governance practices applied beyond the applicable legal requirements are contained in our Business Conduct Guidelines, which are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ :unselected: COMPLIANCE.

## 4\. Description of the operation of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board and of the composition and operation of their committees

Siemens AG is subject to German corporate law. There- fore, it has a two-tier board structure, consisting of a Managing Board and a Supervisory Board. The duties and powers of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board as well as the regulations regarding their operation and composition are defined primarily by the German Stock Corporation Act, the Articles of Association of Siemens AG and the bylaws for the Company's governing bodies. The Articles of Association of Siemens AG, the Bylaws for the Managing Board, the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board and the bylaws for the Supervisory Board's most important committees are available on the Siemens Global Website at www.SIEMENS.COM/ :unselected: CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE.


## Managing Board

In fiscal 2022, the Managing Board of Siemens AG comprised Dr. Roland Busch (President and CEO), Cedrik Neike, Matthias Rebellius, Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas and Judith Wiese. Further information regarding the Managing Board members and their memberships, which

are to be disclosed pursuant to Section 285 No. 10 of the German Commercial Code, are set out in Section 10 of this Corporate Governance Statement. Information about the Managing Board members' areas of responsibility and their curricula vitae are available on the Siemens Global Website at [ WWW.SIEMENS.COM/MANAGEMENT.
 :unselected:
As the top management body, the Managing Board is committed to serving the interests of the Company and achieving sustainable growth in company value. The members of the Managing Board are jointly responsible for the entire management of the Company and decide on basic issues of business policy and corporate strategy, in- cluding Siemens' sustainability strategy, as well as on the Company's annual and multi-year plans, unless specific circumstances are taken into account for companies that are separately managed and publicly listed themselves (Siemens Healthineers). The Companywide DEGREE pro- gram, which was approved by the Managing Board in fiscal 2021, intensified the focus of all Siemens businesses on ambitious sustainability targets - targets for environ- mental and social sustainability and good governance - even further. The Managing Board ensures that the risks and opportunities for the Company connected with social and environmental factors and the environmental and so- cial impact of the Company's activities are systematically identified and assessed. The Company strategy gives due consideration to long-term targets as well as to environ- mental and social objectives. Company planning encom- passes both the appropriate financial targets and the appro- priate sustainability-related objectives. More details on sustainability are available on the Siemens Global Website at
 :unselected:
WWW.SIEMENS.COM/SUSTAINABILITYINFORMATION.

The Managing Board prepares the Company's Quarterly Statements and Half-year Financial Report, the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group and the Com- bined Management Report of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group. Together with the Supervisory Board, the Managing Board prepares the Compensation Report. The Managing Board has established an appropriate and effective internal control system and risk management system that also covers sustainability-related aspects. In addition, it ensures that the Company adheres to statutory requirements, official regulations and internal Company policies and works to achieve compliance with these pro- visions and policies within the Siemens Group. The Man- aging Board has established a comprehensive compliance management system oriented toward the Company's risk

<!-- PageNumber="4" -->

situation. Protection is offered to employees and third par- ties who provide information on unlawful behavior within the Company. Details on the compliance management system are available on the Siemens Global Website at :unselected: WWW.SIEMENS.COM/SUSTAINABILITYINFORMATION.

The Supervisory Board has issued Bylaws for the Manag- ing Board that contain the assignment of different port- folios and the rules for cooperation both within the Man- aging Board and between the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board as well as rules for the so-called Equity Investments. In accordance with these Bylaws, the Man- aging Board is divided into the portfolio of the President and CEO and a variety of Managing Board portfolios. The Managing Board members responsible for the individual Managing Board portfolios are defined in a business as- signment plan that is determined by the Supervisory Board. As the Managing Board member with responsibility for the People & Organization portfolio, the Labor Director (Arbeitsdirektor) is appointed in accordance with the re- quirements of Section 33 of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz, MitbestG). When making recommendations for the first-time appointments of Managing Board members, it is to be taken into account that the terms of these appointments shall not, as a rule, exceed three years.

As a rule, the portfolio assigned to an individual member is that member's own responsibility. Activities and trans- actions in a particular Managing Board portfolio that are considered to be extraordinarily important for the Com- pany or associated with an extraordinary economic risk require the prior consent of the full Managing Board. The same applies to activities and transactions for which the President and CEO or another member of the Managing Board demands a prior decision by the Managing Board. The President and CEO is responsible for the coordina- tion of all Managing Board portfolios. The Managing Board had no committee in fiscal 2022. Further details are available in the Bylaws for the Managing Board on the Siemens Global Website at www.SIEMENS.COM/

BYLAWS-MANAGINGBOARD.

The Managing Board and the Supervisory Board cooper- ate closely for the benefit of the Company. The Managing Board informs the Supervisory Board regularly, compre- hensively and without delay on all issues of importance to the entire Company with regard to strategy (including the Company's sustainability strategy), planning, business

development, financial position, results of operations, compliance and entrepreneurial risks. At regular inter- vals, the Managing Board also discusses the status of strategy implementation with the Supervisory Board.

The members of the Managing Board are subject to a comprehensive prohibition on competitive activity for the period of their employment at Siemens AG. They are com- mitted to serving the interest of the Company. When mak- ing their decisions, they may not be guided by personal interests, nor may they exploit for their own advantage business opportunities offered to the Company. Manag- ing Board members may engage in secondary activities - in particular, supervisory board positions outside the Siemens Group - only with the approval of the Chairman's Committee of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is responsible for decisions regarding any adjust- ments to Managing Board compensation that are neces- sary in order to take account of compensation for second- ary activities. Every Managing Board member is under an obligation to disclose conflicts of interest without delay to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and to inform the other members of the Managing Board thereof.

Further details regarding the operation and composition of the Managing Board are provided in the Bylaws for the Managing Board, which are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at :unselected: WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ BYLAWS-MANAGINGBOARD.


## Supervisory Board

The Supervisory Board of Siemens AG has 20 members. As stipulated by the German Codetermination Act, half of its members represent Company shareholders, and half represent Company employees. The shareholder repre- sentatives on the Supervisory Board are elected at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting by a simple majority vote. Elections to the Supervisory Board are conducted, as a rule, on an individual basis. The employee representa- tives on the Supervisory Board are elected in accordance with the provisions of the German Codetermination Act. Further information regarding the Supervisory Board members and their memberships, which are to be dis- closed pursuant to Section 285 No. 10 of the German Commercial Code, are set out in Section 11 of this Cor- porate Governance Statement. The curricula vitae of the Supervisory Board members are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ :unselected: SUPERVISORY-BOARD and updated annually.

<!-- PageNumber="5" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Corporate Governance Statement" -->

The Supervisory Board oversees and advises the Manag- ing Board in its management of the Company's business. At regular intervals, the Supervisory Board discusses business development, planning, strategy (including sustainability strategy) and strategy implementation. It reviews the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group, the Combined Management Report of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group (including non- financial matters), and the proposal for the appropriation of net income. It approves the Annual Financial State- ments of Siemens AG as well as the Consolidated Finan- cial Statements of the Siemens Group, based on the re- sults of the preliminary review conducted by the Audit Committee and taking into account the reports of the independent auditors. The Supervisory Board approves the Managing Board's proposal for the appropriation of net income and the Report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Supervisory Board is jointly responsible with the Managing Board for the preparation of the Compensation Report. In addition, the Company's adherence to statutory provisions, official regulations and internal Company policies (compliance) are monitored by the Supervisory Board and/or the Audit Committee. The Supervisory Board's oversight and advi- sory activities also encompass, in particular, sustainabili- ty-related topics in the environmental, social and gover- nance (ESG) area. The Managing Board reports regularly to the Supervisory Board on Siemens' Companywide sus- tainability strategy and on the status of this strategy's implementation. The Supervisory Board deals with both the risks and the opportunities for Siemens relating to social and environmental factors and the environmental and social impact of the Company's activities. The Super- visory Board and the Audit Committee also concern themselves with sustainability reporting, which includes the Sustainability Report in addition to reporting on non-financial matters in the Combined Management Re- port, and are kept up to date on new developments and the status of their implementation at Siemens. In addi- tion, the Supervisory Board appoints and dismisses the members of the Managing Board and determines each member's portfolios. The Supervisory Board approves - on the basis of a proposal by the Compensation Commit- tee - the compensation system for Managing Board members and defines their concrete compensation in accordance with this system. It sets the individual targets for the variable compensation and the total compensa- tion of each individual Managing Board member, reviews

the appropriateness of total compensation and regularly reviews the Managing Board compensation system. Im- portant Managing Board decisions - such as those re- garding major acquisitions, divestments, fixed asset in- vestments or financial measures - require Supervisory Board approval unless the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board specify that such authority be delegated to the In- novation and Finance Committee of the Supervisory Board.

Separate preparatory meetings of the shareholder repre- sentatives and of the employee representatives are held regularly in order to prepare the Supervisory Board meet- ings. The Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Managing Board in attendance. Every Supervisory Board member must disclose conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board. Information regarding conflicts of in- terest that may have arisen and their handling is provided in the Report of the Supervisory Board. Special informa- tional (onboarding) events are held in order to familiarize new Supervisory Board members with the Company's business model and the structures of the Siemens Group. The Supervisory Board members take part, on their own responsibility, in the educational and training measures necessary for the performance of their duties - measures relating, for example, to changes in the legal framework and new, groundbreaking technologies. The Company supports them in this regard. Internal informational events are offered when necessary to support targeted training measures.

Details regarding the work of the Supervisory Board are provided in the Report of the Supervisory Board, which is made publicly available for each previous fiscal year on the Siemens Global Website.


## SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES

In fiscal 2022, the Supervisory Board had six committees, whose duties, responsibilities and procedures fulfill the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act and the Code. The chairmen of these committees provide the Supervisory Board with regular reports on their commit- tees' activities.

The Chairman's Committee makes proposals, in particu- lar, regarding the appointment and dismissal of Manag- ing Board members and is responsible for concluding, amending, extending and terminating employment contracts with members of the Managing Board. When

<!-- PageNumber="6" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Corporate Governance Statement" -->

making recommendations for first-time appointments, it takes into account that the terms of these appointments shall not, as a rule, exceed three years. In preparing rec- ommendations regarding the appointment of Managing Board members, the Chairman's Committee takes into account the candidates' professional qualifications, inter- national experience and leadership qualities, the age limit specified for Managing Board members and the long-range plans for succession as well as diversity. It also takes into account the diversity concept for the Manag- ing Board that has been approved by the Supervisory Board. The Chairman's Committee concerns itself with questions regarding the Company's corporate gover- nance and prepares the resolutions to be approved by the Supervisory Board regarding the Declaration of Confor- mity with the Code - including the explanation of devia- tions from the Code - and regarding corporate gover- nance reporting/the Corporate Governance Statement and the Report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. It is responsible for approving the Company's related party transactions. Furthermore, the Chairman's Committee submits recommendations to the Supervisory Board regarding the composition of the Supervisory Board committees and decides whether to approve contracts and business transactions with Managing Board members and parties related to them.

As of September 30, 2022, the Chairman's Commit- tee comprised Jim Hagemann Snabe (Chairman), Dr. Werner Brandt, Jürgen Kerner and Birgit Steinborn.

The Compensation Committee prepares, in particular, the proposals for decisions by the Supervisory Board's plenary meetings regarding the system of Managing Board compensation, including the implementation of this system in Managing Board contracts, the definition of the targets for variable Managing Board compensa- tion, the determination and review of the appropriate- ness of the total compensation of the individual Manag- ing Board members and the annual Compensation Report. Insofar as the non-financial aspects of Managing Board compensation are concerned, the Compensation Committee also considers sustainability in the environ- mental, social and governance (ESG) area.

As of September 30, 2022, the Compensation Committee comprised Michael Diekmann (Chairman), Harald Kern, Jürgen Kerner, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Birgit Steinborn and Matthias Zachert.

The Audit Committee oversees, in particular, the ac- counting and the accounting process and conducts a pre- liminary review of the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group and the Combined Management Re- port of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group, including non-financial matters. On the basis of the independent auditors' report on their audit of the annual financial statements, the Audit Committee makes, after its prelim- inary review, recommendations regarding Supervisory Board approval of the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group. The Audit Committee discusses the quarterly statements and Half-year Financial Report with the Managing Board and the independent auditors and deals with the auditors' reports on the review of the Half-year Consolidated Financial Statements and Interim Group Management Report. The Audit Committee con- cerns itself with sustainability reporting, which includes the Sustainability Report in addition to reporting on non-financial matters in the Combined Management Re- port. It also monitors the Company's adherence to statu- tory provisions, official regulations and internal Company policies (compliance). The Chief Compliance Officer re- ports regularly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Com- mittee concerns itself with the Company's risk monitor- ing system and oversees the appropriateness and effectiveness of its internal control, risk management and internal audit systems as well as the internal process for related party transactions. The Audit Committee re- ceives regular reports from the internal audit depart- ment. It prepares the Supervisory Board's recommenda- tion to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting concerning the election of the independent auditors and submits the corresponding proposal to the Supervisory Board. Prior to submitting this proposal, the Audit Committee obtains a statement from the prospective independent auditors affirming that their independence is not in question. It awards the audit contract to the independent auditors elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and moni- tors the independent audit of the financial statements as well as the auditors' selection, independence, qualifica- tion, rotation and efficiency and the services rendered by the auditors. The Audit Committee assesses the quality of the audit of the financial statements on a regular basis. Outside its meetings, the Supervisory Board is also in reg- ular communication with the independent auditors via the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Com- mittee regularly consults with the independent auditors

<!-- PageNumber="7" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Corporate Governance Statement" -->

also without the Managing Board in attendance. Outside its meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee is in regular communication with the independent auditors regarding the progress of the audit and reports thereon to the Audit Committee.

As of September 30, 2022, the Audit Committee com- prised Dr. Werner Brandt (Chairman), Tobias Bäumler, Bettina Haller, Jürgen Kerner, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Birgit Steinborn, Grazia Vittadini and Matthias Zachert. The members of the Audit Committee are, as a group, familiar with the sector in which the Company operates. Pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board must have at least one member with expertise in the area of accounting and at least one ad- ditional member with expertise in the auditing of finan- cial statements. According to the Code, expertise in the area of accounting consists of specialist knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, while expertise in the area of auditing consists of specialist knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance. In the person of Matthias Zachert, the Super- visory Board and the Audit Committee have at least one member with expertise in the area of accounting and in the person of Dr. Werner Brandt, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, at least one additional member with expertise in the area of auditing. Pursuant to the Code, the chair of the Audit Committee shall be an expert in at least one of these two areas and independent. The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr. Werner Brandt, fulfills these requirements.

In the course of his professional career, Matthias Zachert has served as the chief financial officer of a variety of publicly listed companies and thus has specialist knowl- edge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management sys- tems, including sustainability reporting. His activities as the chief financial officer of a publicly listed international company include engagement with non-financial aspects and the reporting thereon. As the current chief executive officer and former chief financial officer of Lanxess AG, Matthias Zachert has extensive knowledge of the require- ments for sustainability reporting and of current develop- ments in this area. Matthias Zachert follows and moni- tors current developments in sustainability reporting and

actively applies this expertise for the benefit of the Super- visory Board and the Audit Committee of Siemens AG.

Due to his many years of work at a major auditing firm - the former Price Waterhouse GmbH - and his many years of service as the chief financial officer of publicly listed international companies - Fresenius Medical Care AG and, subsequently, SAP AG - Dr. Werner Brandt has spe- cialist knowledge and experience in the auditing of finan- cial statements. Due to his above-mentioned activities and his many years of experience as the chairman of the supervisory board and audit committee of various pub- licly listed international companies, he also has specialist knowledge and experience in the application of account- ing principles and internal control and risk management systems and thus has expertise in the area of accounting. In addition, Dr. Werner Brandt is independent. As former chief financial officer of various companies and as the current chairman of the supervisory board of RWE AG and Chairman of the Audit Committee of Siemens AG, Dr. Werner Brandt also has extensive knowledge regard- ing sustainability reporting. Dr. Werner Brandt follows current developments in sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance and is an active participant in discus- sions of this topic in expert committees. He actively applies this expertise for the benefit of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee of Siemens AG.

The Nominating Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Supervisory Board on suitable candidates for the election by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of shareholder representatives on the Super- visory Board. In preparing these recommendations, the objectives defined by the Supervisory Board for its com- position and the approved diversity concept - in particu- lar, independence and diversity - are to be appropriately considered, as are the proposed candidates' required knowledge, abilities and professional experience. Fulfill- ment of the required profile of skills and expertise is also to be aimed at. Attention shall be paid to an appropriate participation of women and men in accordance with the legal requirements relating to the gender quota as well as to ensuring that the members of the Supervisory Board are, as a group, familiar with the sector in which the Company operates.

As of September 30, 2022, the Nominating Committee comprised Jim Hagemann Snabe (Chairman), Dr. Werner Brandt, Benoît Potier and Dr. Nathalie von Siemens.

<!-- PageHeader="Corporate Governance Statement" -->

The Mediation Committee submits proposals to the Supervisory Board in the event that the Supervisory Board cannot reach the two-thirds majority required for the appointment or dismissal of a Managing Board member on the first ballot.

As of September 30, 2022, the Mediation Commit- tee comprised Jim Hagemann Snabe (Chairman), Dr. Werner Brandt, Jürgen Kerner and Birgit Steinborn.

Based on the Company's overall strategy, the Innovation and Finance Committee discusses, in particular, the Company's innovation focuses and prepares the Super- visory Board's discussions and decisions regarding ques- tions relating to the Company's financial situation and structure - including annual planning (budget) - as well as the Company's fixed asset investments and its finan- cial measures. In addition, the Innovation and Finance Committee has been authorized by the Supervisory Board to decide on the approval of transactions and measures that require Supervisory Board approval and have a value of between €300 million and €600 million.

As of September 30, 2022, the Innovation and Finance Committee comprised Jim Hagemann Snabe (Chair- man), Tobias Bäumler, Harald Kern, Jürgen Kerner, Dr .- Ing. Dr .- Ing. E.h. Norbert Reithofer, Kasper Rørsted, Birgit Steinborn and Grazia Vittadini.

The Supervisory Board has not established a dedicated sustainability committee. Sustainability is one of the fo- cus topics of the Supervisory Board's work. Sustainability is of such central importance for Siemens that it is dis- cussed regularly and in detail at the Supervisory Board's plenary meetings. As a cross-cutting issue, sustainability touches on the areas of responsibility of several commit- tees. To the extent that sustainability affects reporting, the Audit Committee considers sustainability-related questions in detail and reports on these matters at the Supervisory Board's plenary meetings. To prepare for dis- cussions and decisions at these meetings, the sustain- ability-related aspects of Managing Board compensation are dealt with in the Compensation Committee.

Further details regarding the operation and composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees are pro- vided in the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board and the bylaws for its committees, which are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at [ WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ :unselected: CORPORATE-GOVERNANCE.


## SUPERVISORY BOARD SELF-ASSESSMENT

The Supervisory Board and its committees regularly con- duct reviews - either internally or with the involvement of external consultants - in order to determine how effi- ciently they perform their duties. In fiscal 2022, the Su- pervisory Board conducted a comprehensive self-assess- ment with the support of an external consultant. This assessment also took into account the Managing Board's perspective. The Supervisory Board discussed the assess- ment's results and the measures to be derived from it at its meetings on August 10, 2022, and September 23, 2022. The results of the assessment confirm that cooper- ation within the Supervisory Board and with the Manag- ing Board is professional, constructive and characterized by a high degree of trust and openness. The composition and structure of the Supervisory Board, including the structure and mechanisms of its committees, were as- sessed as effective and efficient. The results also confirm that meetings are organized and conducted efficiently and that the participants receive sufficient information. The external consultant confirmed that, in all key catego- ries, the results compare well with those of oversight bodies at other companies. The review did not reveal a need for any fundamental changes. Individual sugges- tions for improvement are also discussed and imple- mented during the year.

5\. Targets, within the meaning of Section 76 para. 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act, for the quota of women at the two management levels below the Managing Board; Information on Managing Board compliance with the participation require- ment and Supervisory Board compliance with minimum gender quota requirements

Pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, the Man- aging Board of Siemens AG must include at least one woman and at least one man (minimum participation requirement). In fiscal 2022, Siemens AG complied with this requirement. Beyond the minimum participation re- quirement, the consideration of women is an essential aspect of the Supervisory Board's long-term succession planning for the Managing Board.

<!-- PageNumber="9" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Corporate Governance Statement" -->

When filling managerial positions at the Company, the Managing Board takes diversity into account and, in par- ticular, aims for an appropriate consideration of women and internationality. In 2017, in compliance with the legal requirements in Germany regarding the equal participa- tion of men and women in management positions set out in the German First Management Positions Act (Erste Führungspositionengesetz), the Managing Board set the target, within the meaning of Section 76 para. 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act, for the percentage of women at each of the two management levels below the Managing Board of Siemens AG at 20%, applicable in each case until June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, these targets had been met. In May 2022, the Managing Board set the targets for the percentage of women in manage- ment positions at Siemens AG that will apply until Sep- tember 30, 2025: 30% for the first management level below the Managing Board and 25% for the second level below the Managing Board. On the basis of projected em- ployee figures, women will, accordingly, hold a total of four of the 13 positions at Siemens AG at the first man- agement level below the Managing Board and a total of 32 of the 126 positions at Siemens AG at the second man- agement level below the Managing Board. For the Siemens Group worldwide, the targets set out in the Companywide DEGREE sustainability framework con- tinue to apply without change.

The composition of the Supervisory Board fulfilled the legal requirements regarding the minimum gender quota in the reporting period.

Statutory provisions on the equal participation of men and women in management positions that may be appli- cable to Group companies other than Siemens AG remain unaffected.


## 6\. Diversity concept for the Managing Board and long-term succession planning

In September 2022, the Supervisory Board approved the following diversity concept for the composition of the Managing Board:

"The goal of this diversity concept is to achieve a com- position that is as diverse as possible and comprises individuals who complement one another in a Manag- ing Board that provides strong leadership and brings different perspectives to the management of the Company as well as to ensure that, as a group, the members of the Managing Board have all the know- how and skills that are considered essential in view of Siemens' activities.

When selecting members of the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board pays close attention to candidates' personal suitability, integrity, convincing leadership qualities, international experience, expertise in their prospective areas of responsibility, achievements to date and knowledge of the Company as well as their ability to adjust business models and processes in a changing world. Diversity with respect to such charac- teristics as age and gender as well as professional and educational background is an important selection cri- terion for appointments to Managing Board positions. When selecting members of the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board also gives special consideration to the following factors:

\> In addition to the expertise and management and leadership experience required for their specific tasks, the Managing Board members shall have the broadest possible range of knowledge and experi- ence and the widest possible educational and pro- fessional backgrounds.

\> Taking the Company's international orientation into account, the composition of the Managing Board shall reflect internationality with respect to different cultural backgrounds and international experience (such as extensive professional experi- ence in foreign countries and responsibility for business activities in foreign countries in areas that are relevant for Siemens).

<!-- PageNumber="10" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Corporate Governance Statement" -->

\-> As a group, the Managing Board shall have experi- ence in the business areas that are important for Siemens - in particular, in the industry, infrastruc- ture, energy, mobility and healthcare sectors.

\> As a group, the Managing Board shall have many years of experience in technology (including in- formation technology, digitalization and cyber- security), sustainability, transformation, procure- ment, manufacturing, research and development, sales, finance, risk management, law (including compliance) and human resources.

\-> Diversity also means gender diversity. According to the legal requirement applicable to Siemens AG (Section 76 para. 3a of the German Stock Corpora- tion Act), the Managing Board must include at least one woman and at least one man (minimum partici- pation requirement). Beyond the minimum partici- pation requirement, the consideration of women is an essential aspect of the Supervisory Board's long- term succession planning for the Managing Board.

\-> It is considered helpful if different age groups are represented on the Managing Board. In accordance with the recommendation of the Code, the Super- visory Board has defined an age limit for the mem- bers of the Managing Board. In keeping with this limit, the members of the Managing Board are, as a rule, to be not older than 63 years of age.

When making an appointment to a specific Managing Board position, the decisive factor is always the Com- pany's best interest, taking into consideration all cir- cumstances in the individual case."


## Implementation of the diversity concept for the Managing Board in fiscal 2022

The diversity concept for the Managing Board is imple- mented as part of the process for making appointments to the Managing Board. When selecting candidates and/or making proposals for the appointment of Manag- ing Board members, the Supervisory Board and/or the Chairman's Committee of the Supervisory Board take into account the requirements defined in the diversity con- cept for the Managing Board.

In its current composition, the Managing Board fulfills all the requirements of the diversity concept. The Manag- ing Board members have a broad range of knowledge,

experience and educational and professional back- grounds as well as international experience. The Manag- ing Board has all the knowledge and experience that is considered essential in view of Siemens' activities. As a group, the Managing Board has experience in the busi- ness areas that are important for Siemens - in particular, in the industry, infrastructure, energy, mobility and healthcare sectors - as well as many years of experience in technology (including information technology, digita- lization and cybersecurity), sustainability, transforma- tion, procurement, manufacturing, research and devel- opment, sales, finance, risk management, law (including compliance) and human resources.

Siemens AG complies with the minimum participation requirement set out in Section 76 para. 3a of the German Stock Corporation Act. The Managing Board has one fe- male member, Judith Wiese. Beyond the minimum par- ticipation requirement, the consideration of women is a key component of the Supervisory Board's long-term succession planning for the Managing Board. Different age groups are represented on the Managing Board. No Managing Board member is currently older than 63 years of age.


### Long-term succession planning for the Managing Board

Jointly with the Managing Board and with the support of the Chairman's Committee, the Supervisory Board con- ducts long-term succession planning for the Managing Board. In its long-term succession planning, the Super- visory Board takes into account the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Code and the Bylaws for the Chairman's Committee as well as the criteria set out in the diversity concept it has approved for the Man- aging Board's composition. Considering the concrete qualification requirements and the above-mentioned criteria, the Chairman's Committee prepares an ideal profile. When a concrete decision regarding succession is to be made, it compiles a shortlist of the available candi- dates on the basis of this profile. Structured interviews are then conducted with these candidates. After the in- terviews, a proposal is submitted to the Supervisory Board for approval. When developing the profile of re- quirements and selecting candidates, the Supervisory Board and the Chairman's Committee are supported, if necessary, by external consultants.

## 7\. Objectives regarding the Supervisory Board's composition as well as the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Super- visory Board

In September 2022, the Supervisory Board approved the objectives for its composition including the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept:

"The composition of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG shall be such that the Supervisory Board's ability to effectively monitor and advise the Managing Board is ensured. In this connection, mutually comple- mentary collaboration among members with a wide range of personal and professional backgrounds and diversity with regard to internationality, age and gender are considered helpful.


## Profile of required skills and expertise

The candidates proposed for election to the Super- visory Board shall have the knowledge, skills and ex- perience necessary to carry out the functions of a Supervisory Board member in a multinational com- pany oriented toward the capital markets and to safe- guard the reputation of Siemens in public. In particu- lar, care shall be taken with regard to the personality, integrity, commitment and professionalism of the individuals proposed for election.

The goal is to ensure that, in the Supervisory Board, as a group, all the knowhow and experience is available that is considered essential in view of Siemens' activities. This includes, for instance, knowledge and experience in the areas of technology (including information tech- nology, digitalization and cybersecurity), sustainability, transformation, procurement, manufacturing, research and development, sales, finance, risk management, law (including compliance) and human resources. In addi- tion, the members of the Supervisory Board shall collec- tively have knowledge and experience in the business areas that are important for Siemens, in particular, in the areas of industry, infrastructure, energy, mobility and healthcare. As a group, the members of the Super- visory Board are to be familiar with the sector in which the Company operates. In accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act, at least one member of the Supervisory Board must have knowledge and expertise

in the area of accounting, and at least one additional member of the Supervisory Board must have knowledge and expertise in the auditing of financial statements. The expertise in the field of accounting shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk man- agement systems and the expertise in the field of audit- ing shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its au- dit and assurance. The chairman of the audit committee shall have appropriate expertise in at least one of the two areas and shall be independent. In particular, the Supervisory Board shall also include members who have leadership experience as senior executives or members of a supervisory board (or comparable body) at a major company with international operations.

When a new member is to be appointed, a review shall be performed to determine which of the areas of ex- pertise deemed desirable for the Supervisory Board are to be strengthened.


## Internationality

Taking the Company's international orientation into account, care shall be taken to ensure that the Super- visory Board has an adequate number of members with extensive international experience. The goal is to make sure that the present considerable share of Supervisory Board members with extensive inter- national experience is maintained.


## Diversity

With regard to the composition of the Supervisory Board, attention shall be paid to achieving sufficient diversity. Not only is appropriate consideration to be given to women. Diversity of cultural heritage and a wide range of educational and professional back- grounds, experiences and ways of thinking are also to be promoted. When considering possible candidates for new elections or for filling Supervisory Board posi- tions that have become vacant, the Supervisory Board shall give appropriate consideration to diversity at an early stage in the selection process.

In accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board is composed of at least 30% women and at least 30% men. The Nominating Committee shall continue to include at least one female member.

<!-- PageNumber="12" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Corporate Governance Statement" -->


## Independence

The Supervisory Board shall include what the share- holder representatives on the Supervisory Board con- sider to be an appropriate number of independent shareholder representatives. More than half of the shareholder representatives shall be independent of the Company and its Managing Board. Substantial - and not merely temporary - conflicts of interest are to be avoided.

No more than two former members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG shall belong to the Supervisory Board.

The Supervisory Board members shall have sufficient time to exercise their mandates with the necessary regularity and diligence.


## Limits on age and on length of membership

In compliance with the age limit stipulated by the Super- visory Board in its Bylaws, only individuals who are no older than 70 years of age shall, as a rule, be nominated for election to the Supervisory Board. Nominations shall take into account the regular limit established by the Supervisory Board, which restricts membership on the Supervisory Board to a maximum of three full terms of office. It is considered helpful if different age groups are represented on the Supervisory Board."

Implementation of the objectives regarding the Supervisory Board's composition as well as the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Supervisory Board in fiscal 2022; Independent members of the Supervisory Board

Within the framework of the selection process and the nomination of candidates for the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board as well as the Nominating Committee of the Supervisory Board take into account the objectives regarding the Supervisory Board's composition and the requirements defined in its diversity concept. In preparing the nominations of the three shareholder representatives elected by the 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meeting and of the seven shareholder representatives to be elected by the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Supervisory Board and the Nominating Committee have taken these objectives - including the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept - into consideration.

The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that, with its cur- rent composition, it meets the objectives for its composi- tion and fulfills the profile of required skills and expertise as well as the diversity concept. The Supervisory Board members have the specialist and personal qualifications considered necessary. As a group, they are familiar with the sector in which the Company operates and have the knowledge, skills and experience essential for Siemens in the areas of technology (including information technol- ogy, digitalization and cybersecurity), transformation, procurement, manufacturing, research and develop- ment, sales, finance, risk management, law (including compliance) and human resources. Due to the presence in the Supervisory Board of expertise in the sustainability- related matters important for Siemens, the Supervisory Board is in a position to monitor the way in which envi- ronmental and social sustainability is taken into consid- eration in the Company's strategic orientation and in Company planning. Knowledge and experience in the business areas important for Siemens - in particular, in the industry, infrastructure, energy, mobility and health- care sectors - are also present in the Supervisory Board. A considerable number of Supervisory Board members are engaged in international activities and/or have many years of international experience. Appropriate consid- eration has been given to diversity in the Supervisory Board. In fiscal 2022, the Supervisory Board had seven female members, of whom three are shareholder repre- sentatives and four are employee representatives. As a result, 35% of the Supervisory Board members are women. Dr. Nathalie von Siemens is a member of the Nominating Committee.

In the estimation of the shareholder representatives, the Supervisory Board now has nine independent shareholder representatives - namely, Dr. Werner Brandt, Benoît Potier, Dr .- Ing. Dr .- Ing. E.h. Norbert Reithofer, Kasper Rørsted, Baroness Nemat Shafik, Dr. Nathalie von Siemens, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Grazia Vittadini and Matthias Zachert - and thus an appropriate number of members who are independent within the meaning of the Code. The regulations establishing limits on age and restricting membership in the Supervisory Board to three full terms of office are complied with.

The implementation status of the profile of required skills and expertise is disclosed below in the form of a qualification matrix.

## 9\. Annual Shareholders' Meeting and investor relations

Shareholders exercise their rights at the Annual Share- holders' Meeting. An ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meet- ing normally takes place within the first five months of each fiscal year. The Annual Shareholders' Meeting de- cides, among other things, on the appropriation of net income, the ratification of the acts of the members of the Managing and Supervisory Boards, and the appointment of the independent auditors. Amendments to the Articles of Association and measures that change the Company's capital stock are approved at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and implemented by the Managing Board. The Managing Board facilitates shareholder participation in this meeting through electronic communications - in par- ticular, via the Internet - and enables shareholders who are unable to attend the meeting to vote by proxy. Proxies can also be reached during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Furthermore, shareholders may exercise their right to vote in writing or by means of electronic commu- nications (absentee voting). The Managing Board may enable shareholders to participate in the Annual Share- holders' Meeting without the need to be present at the venue and without a proxy and to exercise some or all of their rights fully or partially by means of electronic com- munications. The Company enables shareholders to follow the entire Annual Shareholders' Meeting via the Internet. Shareholders may submit motions regarding the proposals

of the Managing and Supervisory Boards and may contest decisions of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Share- holders owning Siemens stock with an aggregate notional value of €100,000 or more may also demand the judicial appointment of special auditors to examine specific issues. The reports, documents and information required by law for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, including the Annual Financial Report, can be downloaded from the Siemens Global Website. The same applies to the agenda for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and to any counter- proposals or shareholders' nominations that may require disclosure. For the election of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board, a detailed curriculum vitae of every candidate is published.

Notes and forward- looking statements

SIEMENS

<!-- PageHeader="Notes and forward-looking statements" -->

This document contains statements related to our future business and financial performance and future events or developments involving Siemens that may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by words such as "expect," "look forward to," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate," "will," "project" or words of similar meaning. We may also make forward- looking statements in other reports, in prospectuses, in presentations, in material delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In addition, our representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the current expectations and certain assumptions of Siemens' management, of which many are beyond Siemens' control. These are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and factors, including, but not limited to, those described in disclosures, in particular in the chapter Report on expected developments and associated material opportunities and risks in the Combined Management Report of the Siemens Report (siemens.com/siemensreport). Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, should decisions, assessments or requirements of regulatory authorities deviate from our expectations, should events of force majeure, such as pandemics, unrest or acts of war, occur or should underlying expectations including future events occur at a later date or not at all or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, performance or achievements of Siemens may (negatively or positively) vary materially from those described explicitly or implicitly in the relevant forward-looking statement. Siemens neither intends, nor assumes any obligation, to update or revise these forward-looking statements in light of developments which differ from those anticipated.

This document includes - in the applicable financial reporting framework not clearly defined - supplemental financial measures that are or may be alternative performance measures (non-GAAP-measures). These supplemental financial measures should not be viewed in isolation or as alternatives to measures of Siemens' net assets and financial positions or results of operations as presented in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Other companies that report or describe similarly titled alternative performance measures may calculate them differently.

Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other documents may not add up precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.

This document is an English language translation of the German document. In case of discrepancies, the German language document is the sole authoritative and universally valid version.

For technical reasons, there may be differences between the accounting records appearing in this document and those published pursuant to legal requirements.
