Delivering performance through purpose

Dear shareholders,

I am pleased to present ABB's first inte- grated report, which explains how our company purpose enables us to drive performance and create value for our stakeholders. The report shows how the various parts of our global company fit together to deliver improved finan- cial results while contributing to a more sustainable society. It also provides an overview of the external environment in which we are operating and how we in- tend to meet our targets in the short-, medium- and long-term. Naturally, the report also covers our performance over the past year and it is these achieve- ments that make me most proud and confident in our team's ability to deliver on our ambitious financial and sustain- ability targets in the years ahead.

In 2022, we as a society faced many challenges - economic, environmental, political and social. The most extreme was of course the devastating war in Ukraine, which resulted in a mass exodus of refugees as well as terrible suffering in the country itself. Beyond Ukraine, the war triggered the energy crisis in Europe,

food shortages in many of the world's poorest countries, and contributed to ris- ing inflation, which is undermining eco- nomic growth as businesses' and house- holds' spending power is reduced.

I am extremely proud of the way that our people at ABB supported those affected by the war through fundraisings and di- rect help on the ground. In response to the war and related international sanc- tions, we also took the decision to exit the Russian market. Here again, we did our utmost to support our Russian col- leagues as we realigned our operations.

The resulting energy crisis is transform- ing global energy markets and has high- lighted the need for a more secure and sustainable energy system. With our lead- ing electrification and automation tech- nologies, ABB is in a strong position to help our customers improve energy ef- ficiency and support the transition to a sustainable and resource-efficient future, in line with our company purpose.

In spite of the war and ongoing supply chain challenges, we delivered strong order and revenue growth in 2022 and achieved our long-term margin target one year early. Orders were up by 16 per- cent, revenues rose by 12 percent and we increased our Operational EBITA to $4.51 billion, delivering a margin of 15.3 per- cent. These results put us well on course to meet our 2023 financial targets. Our earnings per share declined by 43 per- cent to $1.30, largely due to a book gain related to the divestment of the Mechani- cal Power Transmission business in 2021. In line with our policy of paying a ris- ing sustainable dividend over time, we will be proposing a dividend of CHF 0.84 per share to be voted on at ABB's annual general meeting on March 23, 2023.

We also made significant progress in re- ducing ABB's environmental footprint and contributing to a more sustain- able society. We reduced our own green- house gas (GHG) emissions by 43 percent in 2022 by sourcing more power from

<figure>

![](figures/21)

</figure>


renewables, improving energy efficiency at our sites and increasing the number of electric vehicles (EV) in our fleet. We con- tinue to support our customers and sup- pliers in their effort to reduce their own emissions.

Longer-term, as a global technology company with operations in more than 100 countries, we at ABB have an import- ant role to play in helping our customers and communities adapt to challenges and megatrends in our economy and so- ciety. The most pressing of these is cli- mate change, but increasingly we are fac- ing other environmental challenges such as waste disposal and resource deple- tion, which can only be solved by moving towards a circular economy. On top of that, the nature of work and production is being reshaped by demographics and technology as well as changing public

attitudes towards the role of corpora- tions in society.

At ABB, these shifts have helped to de- termine our company purpose as well as our operating model and strategy. We put our purpose of enabling a more sustainable and resource-efficient future through our leadership in electrification and automation at the heart of every- thing we do. To drive a performance cul- ture and strengthen our position in key markets and segments, operating deci- sions are made in the divisions close to the customer and we pursue a strategy of active portfolio management.

In 2022, we acquired strong companies that will improve our technology and market leadership in EV charging and low-voltage electric motors, as well as expand our presence in the rail segment. To further drive our leadership in EV charging, our E-mobility business raised approximately CHF 525 million in a pri- vate placement, the second and final part of which was completed in February 2023. We plan to list our E-mobility busi- ness on the Swiss stock exchange when market conditions are favorable, with ABB retaining a majority shareholding.

In line with our portfolio management strategy of divesting businesses that no longer fit with our strategic focus, we spun off our successful Turbocharg- ing division, creating a new public com- pany, Accelleron. The listing of Accelle- ron on the Swiss stock exchange enables our shareholders to realize the full value of that business while allowing ABB to focus on our core electrification and au- tomation portfolio. Accelleron is a true gem of Swiss industry and will be able to play even better to its strengths as an in- dependent company. Finally, and earlier than expected, we divested to Hitachi ABB's remaining 19.9 percent equity stake in the Hitachi Energy joint venture that was formed from our Power Grids business in 2020.

For me, a highlight of the year was inau- gurating our "Learning Factory Indus- try 4.0" in Berlin with the German Chan- cellor, Olaf Scholz, last September. The new training center is equipped with the latest technologies and demonstrates ABB's commitment to prepare appren- tices for the industry needs of tomorrow.

Looking ahead, as our financial targets show, we are aiming to increase our growth rates, profitability and returns to levels that ABB has not delivered before. We are also pursuing ambitious sustain- ability targets for 2030. Among them, we aim to be carbon neutral in our own operations and to help our customers and tier-one suppliers reduce their GHG emissions. In addition, we will cut waste by having at least 80 percent of our prod- ucts and solutions covered by our circu- larity approach.

ABB's success has always been driven by our talented people and superior tech- nologies. With our agile, high-performing divisions, strong focus on diversity and inclusion and engaged teams, I am cer- tain that ABB will meet its targets and continue to go from strength to strength.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank our stakeholders for their con- tinued trust and support. Together with our customers, employees, partners, sup- pliers and investors, we will continue to create superior value for all of our stake- holders by balancing the needs of society, the economy and the environment.

Best regards,

leto und его

Delivering strong results in the face of formidable

challenges

ABB CEO Björn Rosengren talks to Sandra Wiesner, Corporate Communications, about ABB's performance during a challenging year and explains why ABB's decen- tralized business model is the right one for a global technology com- pany operating in a fast-changing and uncertain world.

## Björn, how would you describe the year 2022? Were you expecting a tough year?

2022 was a crisis year by any reckoning. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had anticipated ongoing supply chain, logistics and labor challenges. But the war in Ukraine took us by sur- prise. Most shocking, of course, was the scale of devastation and human suffer- ing in Ukraine itself. But the resulting energy crisis and rising inflation affected everyone and reminded us that the energy transition is long overdue.

I am extremely proud of the way our people responded to the humanitar- ian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. Although we had no employees based there, our teams arranged safe passage out of the country for employees and their families who were in Ukraine at the time. Some of our employees also tra- velled to Ukraine's borders to transport people fleeing the country to a safe place, while others donated essentials like food and warm clothing to refugees through ABB-driven initiatives. In total, we raised more than CHF 2.2 million in employee and Group donations for the humanitar- ian effort of the International Committee of the Red Cross.

The war had little direct impact on our business, other than our decision to exit the Russian market, where we were pre- sent with 750 people and two production sites, and which accounted for about 1 to 2 percent of our revenues and little of our sourcing. We are in the process of reducing our presence and will complete the exit as soon as possible in compli- ance with applicable laws and sanctions.


### How is ABB helping its customers ad- dress the energy crisis?

Our customers face two main chal- lenges: energy sustainability, which is a long-term challenge for everyone, and energy security, which is a much more urgent concern. Some of our customers have had to deal with power outages;

others have seen their energy bills increase by 50 percent year-on-year.

At ABB, energy and resource efficiency are at the core of our company purpose and value proposition. Most of our products and solutions reduce energy consumption, including our digital and software offerings which help our cus- tomers make better use of their oper- ational data to cut down on energy use and prolong the lifetime of their equip- ment. Our technologies also improve efficiency and productivity in the energy sector itself.


### Overall, how did ABB perform in 2022?

I am very pleased and proud of ABB's performance in 2022. In an increasingly challenging market environment, we continued to win orders and overcame significant supply chain and logistical difficulties to fulfil our commitments to customers.

The proof of our performance can be seen in our high revenues and especially our Operational EBITA margin, where we hit our 2023 target of ≥15 percent one year early. Our strong margin performance shows that our ABB Way operating model, with higher transparency, accountability and speed, is delivering.

This strong performance, especially in such a challenging year, shows that we have the right team in place and that our businesses are focusing on the right mar- ket segments.

ABB announced some important portfolio and leadership changes over the course of the year. How are these working out?

In 2022, we stepped up our portfo- lio management activities to further strengthen our market and technology leadership in electrification and auto- mation. We acquired controlling stakes in two electric-vehicle charging com- panies - InCharge Energy in the United States and Numocity in India - which

<!-- PageNumber="19" -->
:unselected: :unselected:
<!-- PageNumber="20" -->

<!-- PageHeader="ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2022" -->

will significantly strengthen our E-mobility business in those markets. In a private placement completed in Febru- ary 2023, we also raised approximately CHF 525 million to invest in our E-mo- bility business. As of 2023, E-mobility is being treated as a standalone business for managing and reporting purposes. We plan to list the business on the Swiss stock exchange, with ABB retaining a ma- jority stake, once the market conditions are favorable.

In our Motion business area, we announced two important acquisitions. Our NEMA Motors division has agreed to acquire Siemens' low-voltage NEMA motor business, which will strengthen our presence in North America. And in the fourth quarter, our Traction division acquired PowerTech Converter, a leading supplier of auxiliary power converter solu- tions for light rail vehicles and metros, with operations in Germany and the United States. Finally, our Smart Power division acquired ASKI Energy, a leader in energy automation and control systems, with customers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

Part of our portfolio management strategy is to exit businesses that no longer fit with our strategic focus. In October, we spun off our Turbocharging division, creating a new public company, Accelleron, which was listed on the Swiss stock exchange on October 3, 2022. The spin-off allows ABB to focus on our core portfolio of electrification and automa- tion while giving Accelleron the flexibility to operate as an independent company. And earlier than expected, we divested to Hitachi ABB's remaining 19.9 percent equity stake in the Hitachi Energy joint venture that was formed from our Power Grids business in 2020.

Over the course of the year, we had a number of changes in the Executive Committee. On April 1, 2022, Morten Wierod became President of our Electri- fication business area, succeeding Tarak Mehta, who assumed the leadership of our Motion business area from Morten.

Since then, the two business areas have improved their already strong perfor- mance and helped the Group reach our 2023 operational EBITA margin target a year early.

We also had two new colleagues join the Executive Committee in 2022: Andrea Antonelli became Group General Coun- sel and Company Secretary in April and Karin Lepasoon joined ABB in October as Chief Communications and Sustain- ability Officer. Both of them will help to drive forward our successful ABB Way operating model.


## How is ABB progressing towards its 2030 sustainability goals?

Since the launch of our 2030 sustainability strategy in December 2020, we have made strong progress towards our goals of enabling a low-carbon society, preserving resources, promoting social progress and creating a culture of integrity and trans- parency along the extended value chain.

Among our many achievements in 2022, we reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our own operations by 43 percent. And we continue to support our customers in their effort to reduce their own emissions.

We also took important steps to improve sustainability in our supply chain with a new target to help our main tier-one suppliers achieve a 50 percent reduction in their GHG emissions by 2030. And we launched the ABB EcoSolutions label, which provides transparency on the circular value and environmental impact of a product.

Last but not least, we are making good progress in building a safer and more inclusive working environment in which our people can succeed and develop. Since 2019, we reduced the amount of lost time caused by injuries by 42 per- cent. In 2022, we increased the number of women in senior management positions to 17.8 percent, up from 16.3 percent a year ago, in line with our goal of having

<!-- FigureContent="Next chapter" -->

</figure>


25 percent of senior management roles filled by women by 2030.

On December 2, 2022, ABB announced that it had settled with South African, Swiss and American authorities on the legacy Kusile project in South Africa. What led to this outcome and what has it meant for ABB's integrity program?

Since promptly self-reporting to the rel- evant authorities, ABB has fully coope- rated with their investigations into what happened on the Kusile project. We have spent considerable time and effort in supporting their inquiries by providing access to information and the people needed for them to thoroughly complete their investigations. We have performed extensive remediation and enhance- ments across our operations and integ- rity program - including launching a new Code of Conduct, educating employees and implementing an enhanced control system, because we only accept business that is done with integrity and trans- parency. Our cooperation since these investigations commenced has been described as extraordinary, and this is re- flected in the settlements announced on December 2, 2022.

Our work does not stop here as integrity is not a static concept. We will continue to work, innovate and enhance our integ- rity program to have controls, processes and a culture that are effective deter- rents to bribery, corruption and improper behavior.

ABB has a clear purpose and a decen- tralized business model, which you introduced starting in 2020. How do these lead to superior value creation?

ABB's purpose is to enable a more sus- tainable and resource-efficient future with our technology leadership in elec- trification and automation. We can best achieve that through a decentralized business model in which we have clear accountabilities.

In our decentralized structure, our 20 divisions represent the highest level of operating decisions with full ownership and accountability for their respective strategies, performance and resources. This moves decision-making closer to the customer and allows our businesses to operate with speed, which is key to success in today's world.

Collaboration is crucial in our decentral- ized business model and our leaders are encouraged to cooperate and find syner- gies to create competitive advantages. We strongly believe that smart leaders collaborate.

Performance is measured through a trans- parent scorecard system and all divisions have the mandate to be the no. 1 or 2 posi- tion in their respective market segments. To get there, they must be stable and pro- fitable before they focus on growth.

We drive profitable growth organically and through active portfolio manage- ment. This means strategically acquiring companies that will strengthen our core business and divesting or spinning off businesses that no longer fit with our portfolio.


### What in your view sets ABB apart?

In two words - technology innovation. At ABB, we like to say that innovation is in our DNA because we have been innovating since the company was founded in the late 19th century. ABB pioneered many of the technologies that have made the modern world pos- sible, from the first high-speed loco- motive with a direct-drive system to the first microprocessor-controlled industrial robot.

Today, through our market and tech- nology leadership in electrification and automation, we are helping to drive the shift from combustion fuels to electricity as well as reducing resource consump- tion and emissions in industry, buildings and transport, sectors that together account for three quarters of global

<!-- PageHeader="ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2022" -->

energy consumption. In 2022, we invested approximately 4 percent of our consol- idated revenues in R&D activities in our continuing operations.

In December, we opened our most ad- vanced robotics factory, complete with an R&D center, in Shanghai to serve the world's fastest-growing robotics mar- ket. The new facility uses artificial intelli- gence, digital connectivity and software to make robots smarter, more flexible, safer and easier to use. China accounts for more than half of all new robotics in- stallations and we expect the global ro- botics market to grow from around $80 billion today to $130 billion in 2025.


### Looking ahead - what can we expect from ABB in 2023?

Looking into 2023, we currently do not anticipate a major setback in demand, although the high inflationary environ- ment adds uncertainty. We have a vast order backlog, which will keep revenues coming in, as well as the technologies and market-leadership position to take

advantage of growth opportunities as and when they arise.

Energy efficiency and productivity are at the center of our value proposition and these are exactly what our custo- mers need to manage the energy crisis and inflationary pressures. Our products and solutions are also oriented towards longer-term challenges like moving to resource-efficient operations and adapting to tighter labor markets.

Most importantly, we have the right people in the right positions to drive our business forward. Over the past three years, our teams have improved ABB's performance despite huge challenges. That is truly an achievement and one that makes me confident that ABB has what it takes to succeed and support the transition to a sustainable society.

I want to thank the entire ABB team for their commitment and strong perfor- mance in 2022 and to thank our custo- mers, partners, suppliers and sharehold- ers for their continued trust and support.

"I am very proud of our great team and our achievements in what was an extremely challenging year. We protected our people, improved our performance and delivered on our commitments to our stakeholders."

Our strategy and objectives
===

ABB's strategy is deeply rooted in our purpose and designed to accelerate profitable and sustainable growth by capitalizing on global megatrends like sustain- ability, digitalization, electrifica- tion and automation.

Introduced in 2020 and based on our ABB Way operating model, our strat- egy has the overarching objective of creating superior value for all our stake- holders. To achieve this, we set clear strategic priorities for the development of the entire Group, including our busi- ness areas and divisions:

· Systematic capital allocation, both organic and for acquisitions, aligned with ABB's purpose;

· Increase ABB's exposure to high- growth, profitable markets that are benefiting from key megatrends;

· Strive for market leadership positions in all our businesses and enchance our technology and digital leadership

through software-enabled products and systems and stand-alone software and digital services;

. Build resilience to successfully manage a global business in an increasingly volatile world;

. Embed sustainability in all our processes and across our value chain.

In order to achieve ABB's strategic ob- jectives and create superior value for all our stakeholders, we follow consistent strategic and management approaches across all businesses and on all levels of the organization:

· Active portfolio management,

· Performance management,

· Market leadership and digital technology at our core,

· Embedding sustainability in everything we do.

Active portfolio management
===

ABB actively manages its business port- folio to create value through two comple- mentary approaches; organic investment and active portfolio management, inclu- ding major acquisitions. In this way, we increase our exposure to current mega- trends that are shaping the economy and society and that offer attractive business opportunities for us.

Priority setting and capital allocation across divisions: stability and profit- ability before growth

Each of ABB's divisions is assigned a strategic mandate that reflects its performance: stability, profitability or growth.

These strategic mandates reflect the Group's expectations and thus also de- termine the divisions' strategic and per- formance priorities. Divisions in the sta- bility phase are required to restructure or transform their business to significantly and sustainably improve performance. Divisions with a profitability mandate must focus on further improving their profitability while moderately investing in growth - both organic and inorganic. Finally, divisions that are operating at or above their performance targets are mandated to actively pursue orga- nic growth and value-creating, add-on acquisitions.

<figure>

![](figures/46)

<!-- FigureContent="DIVISIONAL STRATEGIC MANDATES Profitability Improve margin/return Stability Moderately invest in growth Restructure Transform offering/ business model Pursue selected technology add-on acquisitions" -->

</figure>



## Growth

Grow above market while maintaining high levels of return

Invest strongly in organic growth (e.g., digital, R&D, sales/service, capacity)

Actively pursue acquisitions: including technology additions, larger market consolidation moves and penetration of new market segments

\> For more information about how we deal with our changing world and related risks and opportunities see chapter "Risks and opportunities".

<!-- FigureContent="Previous chapter" -->

</figure>


<figure>

![](figures/48)

<!-- FigureContent="Next chapter" -->

</figure>


<!-- PageNumber="39" -->

The goal of our portfolio strategy is to bring as many of our divisions into the growth phase as possible. We also seek to improve the quality of our revenues by aligning our business portfolio with more attractive growth markets, developing more long-term business relationships with our customers and reducing our ex- posure to project-driven activities. The strategic mandates of our divisions also support the allocation of capital in the most value-creating manner, in line with ABB's overarching objective of superior value creation.


## Evolution of ABB's portfolio through divestments and acquisitions

To achieve our strategic objectives, we regularly assess ABB's business port- folio according to the following criteria and in line with our Group-wide strategic priorities:

· Fit with ABB and our purpose, complementing existing strengths and capabilities;

· Business and market attractiveness (mid- to long-term growth and attractive profit potential) aligned with key megatrends;

· Potential for value creation and achieving market leadership.

This assessment approach is used both for acquisitions and divestments. Busi- nesses that structurally do not fit these criteria could become exit candidates. This also applies to parts of divisions.

Add-on acquisitions, regardless of size, that ABB's divisions and/or business areas wish to pursue must also match these criteria in order to demonstrate that ABB is a better owner and can create more value than before.

Overall, ABB aims to make at least five small to mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions per year. The majority of such add-on ac- quisitions should be carried out by divi- sions with a growth mandate. The ratio- nale for acquisitions can be the need to fill technology gaps, complement or ex- pand our offering for high-growth seg- ments, gain access to new geographi- cal markets or boost economies of scale through market consolidation. Ultimately, acquisitions are made to improve our po- sition in attractive markets and create additional value.

Performance management
===

\> Please refer to the chapter "Perfor- mance" for more de- tails on our financial and sustainability progress.

By pairing our strategic priorities with a continuous improvement mindset, we aim to deliver better performance on all metrics and consistently deliver supe- rior value creation. We are translating our strategic priorities into a set of short- and long-term targets that are supported by appropriate incentives. These targets en- compass both financial performance and progress on sustainability (see "Embed- ding sustainability in everything we do"). In line with our financial target frame- work, we focus on the five financial key performance indicators (KPIs), as shown on the right-hand side.

The targets and their related incentives are supported by strong performance management through our scorecard sys- tem which is designed to drive continu- ous improvement. We plan, monitor and

incentivize performance using a holistic set of KPIs covering financials, such as revenues, profit and net working capi- tal, as well as sustainability-linked perfor- mance such as reductions in GHG emis- sions, improvements in health & safety and an increase in the proportion of women in senior management positions.

When it comes to capital allocation, ABB's priorities are as follows:

· Funding organic growth, research and development (R&D) and Capex at attractive returns;

· Paying a rising, sustainable dividend per share over time;

· Investing in value-creating acquisitions;

· Returning additional cash to shareholders.

Market leadership and digital technology at our core
===

Market leadership with world-class tech- nology is key to ABB's long-term success. All our divisions have the clear objective to achieve and maintain a no. 1 or 2 posi- tion in their respective markets and both our active portfolio management and per- formance management help us achieve this. Market leadership creates high bar- riers to entry for competitors and helps to improve profitability, drive superior returns, enable growth opportunities for our people and attract talent. It is based on our core competencies, including: cut- ting-edge technology, ability to scale and decades-long domain expertise.

Our world-class technology and domain- led digital capabilities are embedded in our company DNA. Maintaining and ex- tending our technology and digital lead- ership is a strategic priority across our divisions. Pushing the boundaries of

technology enables us to help our custo- mers attain new levels of performance and clearly differentiate ABB's offerings.

As part of ABB's digital strategy, we drive growth in both software-enabled pro- ducts and systems (e.g., drives or break- ers with embedded software) as well as stand-alone software and digital ser- vices (e.g., in Process Automation). ABB Ability™ is our digital brand and plat- form for our extensive portfolio of digi- tal solutions that helps companies au- tomate, optimize and future-proof their businesses to achieve higher levels of per- formance and drive sustainable progress. Digital solutions offer significant growth potential and help us boost other stra- tegic priorities. Therefore, we invest in digital organically and complement this through partnerships and venture invest- ments as well as acquisitions.

Embedding sustainability in everything we do
===

At ABB, sustainability is at the center of our company purpose and the value we create for our stakeholders. We believe that sustainable development means progress towards a healthier and more prosperous world, today and for fu- ture generations. To achieve this, we balance the needs of society, the envi- ronment and economy across our entire value chain, creating superior value for our customers, suppliers, employees and society.

Our 2030 sustainability strategy posi- tions our company to address the world's greatest sustainability challenges. As a technology leader, we focus on those ar- eas where we can make the biggest im- pact: enabling a low-carbon society, pre- serving resources and promoting social progress, while applying our own high standards for integrity and transparency and complying with relevant regulations wherever we operate. To meet our 2030 sustainability targets, we are taking ac- tion across the value chain because we believe we can have a greater impact by acting in coordination with our custo- mers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our sustainability strategy is based on the following four objectives:

\> More information about our sustain- ability strategy and governance can be found in our Sustain- ability Report 2022.

. Enabling a low-carbon society: We partner with our customers and suppliers to reduce and avoid value- chain emissions, and we aim to make our own operations carbon-neutral by 2030.

· Preserving resources: We aim to embed circularity across our value chain. Many

of our solutions reduce waste, increase recycling and foster reusability.

· Promoting social progress: We take care of our employees and promote social progress around the world. We strive to create safe, fair and inclusive working environments where people can succeed and develop, and we support community-building.

· Creating a culture of integrity and transparency: : We drive a culture of integrity and transparency across our value chain and take accountability for our actions.

For each of the four pillars of our sustain- ability strategy, we have defined targets for the three levels of our value chain; our customers, our own operations and our suppliers. In 2022, we announced a new supplier emissions target to help enable a low-carbon society, and will work with our main tier-one suppliers to reduce their GHG emissions by 50 percent by 2030 compared to 2019.

We have set up a clear sustainability gover- nance model. Responsibility for meeting our sustainability targets lies with our busi- ness areas and divisions and progress in implementation is regularly reviewed by our Sustainability Board, comprising the Executive Committee members. The ulti- mate oversight and responsibility lies with the ABB Board of Directors. By meeting our sustainability targets for 2030, we will contribute to the United Nations' Sustain- able Development Goals (SDGs), of which ABB has been a strong advocate. Only with a joint and concerted effort that includes business will we as a society be able to achieve a sustainable future for us all.

How we create value

≡

<!-- PageHeader="Table of contents" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Previous chapter" -->

<figure>

![](figures/57)

<!-- FigureContent="Next chapter" -->

</figure>


As a global company, we are embedded in our markets, ecosystems, communities and society as a customer, employer, partner, supplier, income provider, taxpayer, community member and corporate citizen.

Our purpose, strategic objectives and operating model are all focused on creating superior value for all our stakeholders. To run our business and be successful, we rely on many forms of "capital" - financial, intellectual, natural, manufactured, human, social and rela- tionship. They enable us to operate, be in- novative, realize our continuous improve- ment mindset and come up with the best solutions for our customers while creating wealth for our investors and increasing value across many different dimensions. Our value creation model transforms the contributions (= inputs) from those va- rious capitals via our operating model, the ABB Way, into our outputs which then turn into outcomes. These in turn also represent impacts on the capitals, as through our value creation model they can be increased, decreased or transformed.

\> Read more about our stakeholder engage- ment in the chapter "Stakeholder engage- ment and material topics".

Because our capital flows are closely interconnected, our success and ability to deliver on our commitments to stakeholders depends on maintain- ing a healthy and sustainable balance among our various capitals. To achieve this, we take an integrated approach to

our business and manage it holistically to guard against maximizing one form of capital at the expense of another. We see ourselves as responsible stewards of the capitals available to us and hold ourselves accountable for the way we use them, knowing that this ultimately impacts all of our stakeholders. Only by balancing all capitals and creating holis- tic value can we be successful in the lon- ger term. This approach is reflected in the six outcomes that we pursue, each of which is linked to a capital input and aligned with our strategic objective, which is to create superior value:

· by delivering financial performance, · through world-class technology,

· by enabling a low-carbon society,

· by preserving resources,

· by promoting social progress,

· by driving ethical and sustainable practices across our value chain.

Each of these outcomes and related out- puts is explained in more detail in the chapter "Performance".

Our value creation model is not only rooted in our purpose of enabling a more sustainable and resource-efficient future with our technology leadership in elec- trification and automation but also em- bedded in our relationships with our key stakeholder groups. We receive value from them and in return create value for them. The goal of our value creation is to posi- tively impact all our stakeholders.

Our operating model - the ABB Way
===

The ABB Way is the common operating model for our divisions, business areas and lean corporate center. It is the "glue" that holds the Group together and has at its core ABB's purpose, i.e., the "why" we are in business.

The ABB Way defines "how" we create value: how we drive performance, how we ensure that we have the right people in the right place at the right time, how we create a strong culture of governance and integrity and how we build and protect our brand and reputation. The ABB Way is owned and controlled by ABB's Executive Committee and is mandatory for all busi- nesses in ABB.

Our business model
===

Our business model determines how we govern, steer and manage the per- formance and portfolios of our 20 divi- sions. Under our decentralized business model, our divisions represent the high- est level of operating decisions within ABB with full ownership and accountabi- lity for their respective strategies, per- formance and resources. Our divisions drive value creation with the clear aim of being no. 1 or 2 in their respective market segments.

Performance management and portfo- lio reviews of the divisions are carried out by our four business areas - Electri- fication, Motion, Process Automation

and Robotics & Discrete Automation - using a transparent scorecard system. Business areas also manage selected, shared resources on behalf of the divi- sions, such as R&D and the ABB Ability™ digital platform.

Collaboration is crucial in our decentral- ized business model. Business leaders are encouraged to cooperate and find synergies to create competitive advan- tages. Such collaboration can range from internal benchmarking or best-practice sharing to sharing of business resources (e.g., digital platform, account manage- ment). We strongly believe that smart leaders collaborate.

Our people & culture
===

At ABB, we understand that sustainable value is created by people working to- gether in supportive environments that encourage creativity and collaboration and reward performance.

To attract, retain and nurture talent, we are building safe, fair, equitable and in- clusive working environments in which our people can succeed and develop. Our performance culture is characterized by our ABB values of courage, care, curi- osity and collaboration, supported by ro- bust performance and review processes.

For more information about our people- related performance, please refer to the chapter "We promote social progress".

Our four values reflect the attitudes and behaviors we need to drive our decen- tralized company with its empowered divisions. They guide and shape our be- havior and interactions with each other, our customers and partners, and society as a whole.

To help our people succeed, we provide opportunities for learning and personal development and empower them to ma- nage their own careers within ABB

with our open job market, where all po- sitions up to Executive Committee level are posted internally and anyone may ap- ply. A key focus of our people strategy is leadership development - our leadership teams review the strengths and develop- ment needs of their team members and support their development so that they are ready to pursue new opportunities when they arise.

Relying on our people's unique attitudes, experiences and domain expertise, we push the boundaries of technology to drive performance, shape new business models and find new ways of working that bring valuable benefits to our cus- tomers, partners and society overall. We actively seek partnerships with our cus- tomers to drive value creation and sus- tainable development.

<!-- PageNumber="73" -->

Next chapter

We safeguard our business and our company from financial and reputa- tional harm with a comprehensive governance framework that defines how we work, collaborate and do busi- ness across our organization. We are committed to fostering a culture in which integrity is woven into the fabric of everything we do.

To embed integrity in our own operations as well as throughout our entire value chain, our Code of Con- duct guides our employees to fol- low the law, act honorably and treat each other with respect. The code also forms the basis of our interactions with projects and counterparties and underpins our commitment to ethi- cal behavior and human rights. Our Supplier Code of Conduct describes ABB's expectations of our suppliers and is included in our standard terms and conditions.

Through our Sustainable Supply Base Management (SSBM) approach, we as- sess sustainability risks, compliance and the performance of our suppliers to make sure they meet our expecta- tions. To strengthen our sustainability ambitions from a governance perspec- tive, we are also embedding sustaina- bility targets in our senior manage- ment incentive awards.

≡ Table of contents

We maintain regular contact and com- munication with our stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers and employees. We also conduct a transparent dialogue with the capital markets to enable par- ticipants to make informed investment decisions on a timely basis. Further- more, we engage with industry peers, partners, governments and organizations from civil society.

Beyond business-as-usual discussions, we engage with stakeholders for specific strategic and reporting purposes. We are

especially interested in understanding how they perceive value and what mat- ters to them as far as economic, environ- mental and social issues are concerned. These insights shape our strategic deci- sions and the way we manage risks and opportunities and they help determine the actions we take and how we com- municate to enhance transparency and accountability. This dialogue helps us to identify and anticipate emerging trends, shifting customer needs and changing market expectations.

Material topics
===

\> More information about our engage- ment with stake- holders, material topics and the re- lated process can be found in our Sustain- ability Report 2022.

Stakeholder engagement allows ABB to assess and disclose matters that sub- stantively affect our ability to create value for our stakeholders over the short, medium and long term.

In 2020, ABB conducted a comprehen- sive stakeholder engagement process to identify material sustainability topics. More than 300 stakeholders across our four business areas were interviewed and based on their feedback, each business area created its own materiality matrix for sustainability. These matrices were then aggregated into an overall ma- trix for the Group, which was used as the basis for determining our 2030 sus- tainability strategy and related targets. The identified topics impact not only

sustainability but also our financial per- formance, our ability to create value and our reputation. They can be summarized in three categories as shown below.

In 2022, we conducted follow-up dis- cussions with our investors, customers and suppliers about ABB's sustainability performance.

In 2023, we will further enhance and update our comprehensive material- ity assessment with internal and exter- nal stakeholder engagement, based on a double materiality approach, consid- ering both the impact that ABB has on the environment and society, and the im- pact the topics have on ABB's business success.

To fulfil our purpose and create superior value, we must identify, assess, mitigate and manage risks and opportunities facing our business.

In doing so, we take a broad view of the external environment and megatrends and actively try to prevent risks from materializing while at the same time turning challenges into opportunities. Our holistic approach covers both finan- cial and sustainability-linked aspects of enterprise risk management and special emphasis is placed on climate-related fi- nancial risks and opportunities through the adoption of the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Finan- cial Disclosures (TCFD).

As the pace of change and uncertainty increases, ABB closely monitors mega- trends that are shaping the external en- vironment, analyzes economic and geo- political shifts and adapts accordingly through its agile and decentralized busi- ness model.

In many economies around the world, in- dustry's share of GDP is shrinking and the service sector is expanding. At the same time, companies are increasingly focused on resilience and reshoring to guard against supply chain challenges in the wake of the pandemic, as well as bracing for a downturn as the energy crisis and inflation reduce businesses' and house- holds' spending power. For ABB, as a leader in electrification and automation, these are challenges to be managed, but they also represent an important busi- ness opportunity. To take advantage of them, and support our customers with more sustainable solutions, we need more proactive planning, monitoring and management.

On a societal level, demographic change is increasing the size of the population but also shrinking the labor force, creat- ing a need for increased labor productiv- ity. Businesses are also grappling with a lack of qualified and experienced work- ers, which makes attracting and retain- ing talents a priority for ABB. At the same time, pressure is growing to improve hu- man and labor rights and respect for di- versity, leading to safer, more equitable

and inclusive working environments and greater focus on community engage- ment and development. Across the world, rapid urbanization is driving the need for smart buildings and infrastructure and e-mobility.

These developments are being enabled by technology but are also increasing de- mand for energy and putting more pres- sure on the planet's resources. To limit climate change and resource scarcity, bold and ambitious action is needed to decarbonize the energy system, improve energy and resource efficiency and move towards a circular economy.

With its advanced automation, robot- ics and digital technologies, ABB is well positioned to tackle these pressing challenges and turn them into business opportunities. Our innovative technolog- ical solutions increase productivity and resource efficiency and improve man- ufacturing flexibility, quality and sim- plicity. Our purpose of enabling a more sustainable and resource-efficient future with our technology leadership in elec- trification and automation addresses the megatrends shaping the economy and places ABB in a strong position to drive and support the technologi- cal advances that are needed to achieve a sustainable society.

Every event, factor or circumstance that could adversely affect ABB's ability to achieve its business ob- jectives and create value is a risk. Therefore, risk management within a strong governance framework is an integral part of our business.

Yet, at ABB we don't only try to minimize risks, we seek to turn them into opportu- nities and create value for our stakehold- ers and society. Our goal is to responsi- bly manage both risks and opportunities, which also includes taking certain risks and getting paid for it. We are well equipped to do so, thanks to our pur- pose, our ABB Way operating model and our diverse portfolio.

Enterprise Risk Management
===

ABB's enterprise risk management (ERM) process provides managers and the Board of Directors, including the Board's Finance, Audit and Compliance Commit- tee (FACC), with a comprehensive and holistic view of the risks facing our busi- ness. This information informs our overall strategic and risk discussions and allows us to make better informed decisions and take calculated risks to create value for our stakeholders.

The ERM process is typically cyclical in nature, enabling the continuous refine- ment of risk management in a dynamic business environment. It starts with the identification of business objectives and related risks that could prevent their successful achievement. Risks are as- sessed in terms of their potential im- pact, likelihood, and speed with which an impact could occur should the risk mate- rialize. Risk mitigation measures are then

<!-- PageHeader="≡ Table of contents" -->

planned, implemented and monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure their ef- fectiveness. ERM assessments are both top-down and bottom-up. They cover strategic, financial and operational risks, in the short, medium and long term.

Our ERM process is aligned with our strategy and the ABB Way, our operating model, and links to our values of courage, care, curiosity and collaboration. All busi- ness areas, divisions and corporate func- tions are required to identify, assess and report their top five risks as a minimum each year based on a defined methodol- ogy and governance.

Risks are classified in one of the follow- ing three categories based on a compre- hensive ERM risk catalogue:


## 1\. Strategic

This category includes strategic risks which can significantly impact the execu- tion of our business strategies, the man- agement of our portfolio and our abil- ity to achieve our objectives. At ABB, we typically include external and emerging risks in this category, such as industry and technological shifts, macroeconomic developments and geopolitical aspects. These can impact our business negatively in the long term but can also create busi- ness opportunities.


## 2\. Operational

This category includes operational and commercial risks which arise as a result of our day-to-day dealings with custom- ers and suppliers as well as engineering, manufacturing and product manage- ment. Other examples in this category include integrity and compliance, health, safety and environment, supply chain management, cyber and information se- curity, physical asset management and talent attraction and retention.


## 3\. Financial

This category includes financial risks which arise as a result of ABB's interna- tional activities such as currency or in- terest-rate fluctuations and commodity price volatility. Risks relating to account- ing and financial reporting requirements, financial planning, analysis and man- agement, and tax obligations are also covered.

\> Further details on how we manage financial risks by using derivative financial instru- ments can be found in the Financial Re- port 2022 in Note 6 "Derivate financial instruments".

Across all categories of risk, ABB actively aims to prevent risks from materializing and reduce potential adverse impacts by designing, im- plementing and monitoring a wide range of mitigation actions, con- trols and governance.

Based on the 2022 ERM process, the following top five risk clusters were identified for ABB.

\> For more information about how we man- age our sustainability risks, please refer to the chapters on "Hu- man rights" and "Re- sponsible sourcing" in our Sustainability Report 2022.

In addition to the risks covered above, we place special emphasis on sustainability- related risks and opportunities, not least because they can impact all other risk categories. Being both a mega- trend and part of our company purpose, sustainability is a significant business opportunity as well as one of the reasons that we are in business. For example, we are enabling a low-carbon society with our electrification and automation solu- tions. Our clients and partners rely on our innovative and sustainable technologies for holistic benefits. See the following page for an example of how sustainabil- ity turns into a business opportunity for ABB.

Sustainability risks and climate change in particular can impact our operations and financial performance. That is why we support the Task Force on Climate-re- lated Financial Disclosures (TFCD) frame- work and include it in our reporting (see next chapter). Further sustainability-re- lated aspects of our risk management in- clude, among others:

· Human rights risk management and mitigation: these are part of our standard risk review process for screening major ABB projects, supplier engagements and potential mergers & acquisitions.

· Supplier risks and conflict minerals: we rely on our Sustainable Supply Base Management (SSBM) and conflict minerals management programs to manage risks related to our relationships with suppliers.

. Integrity risks: we assess and monitor reputational and legal risks arising from our relationships with third parties, including our sales channel, as well as from our own teams to mitigate fraud, corruption and any other risks related to business ethics.

To manage our sustainability risks, we have several policies, governance struc- tures and measures in place, includ- ing: Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct. The latter is derived from our Code of Conduct and takes account of the 10 principles of the UN Global Com- pact, the ABB Policy Combating Traffick- ing in Persons, the ABB Policy on Con- flict Minerals, our Human Rights policy and statement, our Social policy, supply chain and contractor questionnaires, as well as internal policies and guidelines. Furthermore, we dispose of a business ethics helpline, a Sustainability Board, Health/Safety/Environment (HSE) & Se- curity functions as well as regular train- ings and audits.

We also have due diligence practices in place and continuously work towards further improvements, including assess- ing risks related to conflict minerals and child labor as will be required in 2023 by Swiss law, in accordance with the coun- terproposal to the Responsible Business Initiative. We have established a "Conflict Minerals Compliance Program" to review the use of conflict minerals in our prod- ucts and are committed to not buying products and materials containing con- flict minerals directly from conflict mines and working towards conflict-free trade with our suppliers. With the Form SD Specialized Disclosure Report, we submit our Conflict Minerals Report to the US SEC. We support the principles contained in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Core Conven- tions on Labour Standards and are com- mitted to implementing the United Na- tions Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) throughout our operations and along the value chain. We issue a Modern Slavery Statement an- nually pursuant to the U.K. Modern Slav- ery Act 2015 and the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018.

### ABB partners with Samsung Electron- ics to drive holistic smart building technology

\> For more information about how we man- age our sustainability opportunities, please refer to our Sustain- ability Report 2022.

In 2022, we entered a collaboration with Samsung Electronics to provide remote monitoring and control solutions that de- liver energy and cost savings in residential and commercial buildings. By connecting Samsung's SmartThings application to ABB's home automation solutions, resi- dents will be able to monitor and manage their appliances, gas and smoke sensors,

energy, security and comfort systems from a single application. This partnership is just one example of how the challenge of reducing energy consumption can be turned into a business opportunity that makes buildings more sustainable while improving people's quality of life.

As a company that is exposed to the consequences of climate change and at the same time can have a considerable influence on climate change mitigation and adaptation, we strongly identify with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to report on how we contribute towards climate change mitigation through GHG emissions reduction, how we reduce our negative impact and what climate change means to ABB in terms of financial risks and opportunities and business resilience.

This is our first report in line with the structure proposed by TCFD, but we have been reporting towards similar disclo- sures through our CDP climate question- naires for many years. We will continue developing our TCFD reporting in the next year, in line with the upcoming Swiss Ordinance on Climate Reporting and U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Climate Risk Disclosures.

Climate-related strategy

Climate-related risks

and opportunities

We continuously identify, monitor and manage climate-related risks and oppor- tunities over the short- (1 year), medium- (2-5 years) and long-term (5-20 years). They fall into two major categories: risks related to the physical impacts of climate change and risks related to the transition towards a low-carbon economy, which are already present to some extent. As global temperatures rise, acute physical risks will become more likely and may be- come more severe. New additional risks may also emerge. Long-term climate risks and opportunities are assessed in our analyses of science-based climate and emissions scenarios. These help us to understand how our global emissions in our value chain must progress over the coming 10, 15 and 20 years, and serves as a basis for assessing options and costs, and for setting long-term targets.


## Physical risks

Physical risks are direct effects from cli- mate change and can result in extreme weather events such as hurricanes or floods or in long-term chronic climate conditions like sustained higher tem- peratures leading to rising sea levels or more severe heat waves. These risks can have financial implications through dam- age to assets, reduced availability of re- sources or disruption of operations and supply chains.

For example, ABB sites around the world are vulnerable to water-related incidents caused by extreme weather events, such as flooding from heavy rain, storms or hurricanes. These events may cause dis- turbances or interrupt production for several months at a time. They can also affect our supply chain. If the produc- tion of key suppliers is interrupted as

has happened in the past due to severe flooding in South-East Asia, our own pro- duction and revenues may be impacted as well. Upstream risks related to climate change are business continuity risks that are typically part of the ongoing dialogue that ABB has with its suppliers.


## Transitional risks

As the world tries to move towards a lower-carbon economy, the increas- ing challenge of climate change may lead to significant changes in the exter- nal environment in which we are operat- ing. Measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change may lead to significant policy, legal, technological and market changes that would affect our finan- cial position, strategic decisions and the way we operate.

An example of emerging regulation would be carbon pricing mechanisms. Today, ABB is already paying carbon taxes in several countries, particularly in Europe, and carbon tax legislation and the carbon price are likely to increase in the coming years. The higher our scope 1 emissions, the more carbon tax we pay. Therefore, reducing our GHG emissions is not only good for the environment, but also for our business.


## Climate-related opportunities

Climate change can also represent oppor- tunities for growth, improvements and value creation. With our purpose, strategy and operating model, we believe that ABB is best positioned to help the world mitigate and adapt to climate change and create financial value at the same time. By increasing energy efficiency, switch- ing to renewable energy sources and

<!-- PageHeader="ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2022 RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES" -->

moving toward circular business models, we are able to reduce costs and improve resilience even in times of crisis. With our leading technologies, we can make an even bigger impact in our customers' op- erations. By helping them reduce energy and resource consumption and avoid emissions, we make them more sustain- able while driving further demand for our products, solutions and services.

To help our customers reduce GHG emis- sions, we have identified products and solutions from our portfolio that deliver emissions reductions. These include en- ergy-efficient electric motors and drives and advanced automation, digital and electrification solutions for energy- intensive industries. As many customers

lack expertise in energy management, ABB offers an end-to-end approach and one-stop-shop for building automation and smart energy management solu- tions. These include the ABB Ability™ Building Ecosystem, NeoGear low-voltage switchgear solutions and the ABB Abil- ity™ Energy and Asset Manager. Crucially, we also support the energy transition with technologies that integrate power from intermittent renewable sources into the electricity grid. For ABB, this rep- resents a huge opportunity both in the short- and medium-term.

\> More information on EU Taxonomy can be found in our Sustain- ability Report 2022.

We assess the impact of climate-related risks on ABB and its value chain and what they could mean in terms of finan- cial costs, as well as how we can mitigate them. At the same time, we also con- sider the opportunities that such risks create for us as a business to drive value creation. The identification of climate- related business impacts and effects is also part of our strategic planning pro- cess as ABB has clearly identified climate change as a long-term, global challenge that requires low-carbon, high efficiency solutions. Our business strategy is sup- ported by our long-term commitment to innovation and technology leadership in areas such as high-efficiency electrifica- tion, automation and control systems, robotics and motion solutions, and tech- nologies to capture the full potential of renewable energies. Through our sustain- ability strategy 2030 and by joining the "Business Ambition for 1.5℃" pledge, we are committed to achieving carbon neu- trality by 2030 in our own operations and to net-zero value chain GHG emissions by no later than 2050.

We can significantly contribute towards a low-carbon society through our prod- ucts, systems and services that help our customers reduce GHG emissions. The

related market opportunities, which in- clude smart building solutions, urban infrastructure, clean energy, energy ef- ficiency and mobility systems, are pro- jected to be worth more than $5 trillion by 2030 (Business and Sustainable Devel- opment Commission, January 2017).

ABB has also identified water and waste- water as a growth segment that also plays an important role in climate discus- sions. In 2022, approx. 3 percent of our revenues came from this growth seg- ment. In addition, we continuously invest in improving our energy and climate per- formance, which makes our operations more sustainable and resilient. In 2021, we started to assess the extent to which our activities are reflected in the Euro- pean Union's common classification sys- tem for sustainable economic activities, known as the "EU Taxonomy" and con- tinued with the alignment assessment in 2022.

The following table provides an overview of some of the main risks and opportuni- ties that we have identified through our risk management processes (see more under "Risk and opportunity manage- ment"), what they mean for us and how we deal with them:

ABB has reviewed the various RCP (Rep- resentative Concentration Pathway) sce- narios of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) to inform our understanding of physical risks linked to our operations and to our 2030 sustain- ability strategy. We have based our as- sessment of our climate-related physical risks on RCP 4.5, which is an intermediate scenario likely to result in a global tem- perature rise of 2-3℃ by 2100. In this sce- nario, sea levels are expected to rise and extreme weather events, including heavy precipitation, drought and heat waves, to become more frequent. Our sites are prepared for emergencies to keep our people safe and maintain business conti- nuity. These analyses feed into our busi- ness continuity plans and preparations. For example, we use the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Aqueduct global water risk tool to assess our facilities accord- ing to the level of baseline water stress of the local watershed. Of the 332 ABB locations mapped in 2022, 36 face an ex- tremely high level of water stress, 58 face a high level and 39 face a medium-to-high level. The tool not only helps us assess water stress at our sites, but also the lev- els of groundwater depletion, flood risk and seasonal variability of water avail- ability at our sites, which is extremely useful for our work in managing water risk.

ABB has also used different scenarios to understand the speed at which we need to decarbonize our own operations to be in line with scientific estimates. This helped us set science-based targets in line with the 1.5℃ trajectory of the Paris Agreement, in which ABB commits to re- duce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emis- sions by at least 80 percent between 2019 and 2030.

Many of ABB's technologies directly ad- dress the causes of climate change and our market opportunity and value proposition assessments and product/ systems development roadmaps, rely di- rectly or indirectly on climate-related sce- nario analysis and expectations linked to climate-related policy and standards development. For longer-term trends, the analysis shows that ABB is well posi- tioned in very attractive markets. We will further intensify our work on climate risk modelling in the coming year to be able to provide an even more comprehensive analysis including financial quantification of risks and opportunities.

Climate risk management
===

ABB includes climate-related risks in its company-wide Enterprise Risk Manage- ment (ERM) process. This holistic risk management process supports the iden- tification, assessment and mitigation of climate-related risks and considers their potential negative impact for us in achieving our business objectives and creating value. Climate risks are also con- sidered in terms of their potential effects on our suppliers and customers across the value chain.

ABB has well-developed emergency response programs to manage poten- tial impacts from climate change, such as storms, floods or threats to the wa- ter supply. These include, for example, ABB's facility and workplace emergency preparedness, protocols for unexpected emergencies and ABB's mandatory busi- ness continuity plans for our sites. Our Insurance Risk Management function works closely with our global insurance providers to identify risks to our assets and operations. Reviews of facilities are conducted annually or biennially, depend- ing on the value of the asset. Incentive and penalty programs are in place to pro- mote implementation of best practices and risk mitigation and avoidance rec- ommendations. All facilities are required to develop, implement and test business continuity plans.

Our risk management approach also covers upstream business continuity risks related to climate change, such as extreme weather conditions affecting our suppliers. This includes comprehen- sive monitoring and development of our supply base to ensure sustainability, both in terms of materials and processes used and is typically part of the ongoing dialogue that ABB has with its suppliers.

We operate a worldwide supply chain management network with employees dedicated to this function in our busi- ness areas, divisions and in key countries. Upstream climate change risks and op- portunities are also considered and an- alyzed in our assessment of upstream scope 3 emissions, where we identify the climate impact of all relevant scope 3 categories. With our Sustainable Sup- ply Base Management (SSBM) program, we have a comprehensive approach in place, which includes surveillance of the sustainability performance of our suppli- ers. It involves supplier screening, train- ing, on-site assessment, monitoring and follow-up until all identified non- conformities are closed. We aim to ad- dress sustainability topics and perfor- mance at each stage of supplier lifecycle management as part of our "beyond au- dit" approach and have at least 80 per- cent of our supply spend in focus coun- tries covered by SSBM by 2030.

For mitigating transitional risks linked to our exposure to current and potential carbon taxes, as well as realizing oppor- tunities linked to cost savings, we invest in energy efficiency and emissions re- ductions throughout our operations. We have committed to electrifying our fleet of more than 10,000 vehicles by 2030 and to continue deploying energy manage- ment systems at the company's sites. Our substantial annual investments in en- ergy efficiency and emissions reduction projects frequently come along with fa- vorable break-even time. This includes in- vestments in low-carbon energy sources, compressed air systems, heating, venti- lation and cooling systems. The largest part of the investment was made in energy-efficient lighting.

Climate-related metrics and targets
===

Through our sustainability strategy 2030 and by joining the "Business Ambi- tion for 1.5℃" pledge, we are committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 (scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions) and net- zero value chain GHG emissions before 2050. These targets are validated and approved by the Science Based Target initiative.

By 2030, we will reduce our own emis- sions by at least 80 percent and work with our customers and suppliers to re- duce their emissions and implement sus- tainable practices across our value chain.

By 2030, we aim to cover at least 80 per- cent of ABB's portfolio of products and solutions with a circularity approach and send zero waste to landfill while taking measures to prevent waste generation.

We track our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, as well as waste generation and wa- ter withdrawal, especially from water- stressed areas.

We also aim to increase the share of our economic activities related to turnover, Opex and Capex that are classified as sustainable in accordance with the EU Taxonomy, especially through their con- tribution towards the environmental ob- jectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Orders and revenues
===

\> For additional infor- mation and analysis about individual business area revenues and order performance, refer to the relevant sections of "Business analysis" in our Financial Report 2022.

1 For non-GAAP measures see chap- ter "Alternative per- formance measures".

In 2022, total orders increased 7 percent compared with 2021 (16 percent compa- rable1). All business areas contributed to the robust order growth due to strong demand across all regions and most cus- tomer segments. A favorable trend was noted for the product and project busi- ness as well as service. In addition to strong underlying markets, the order in- take was additionally supported in the first half of the year by customers placing some orders early in an effort to secure deliveries in an environment with gener- ally tight supply chains. As supply chain constraints progressively eased during the latter part of the year, customer or- der patterns normalized. For the year in total, both volumes and pricing contri- buted to the robust growth development, more than offsetting the negative im- pact from exchange rate fluctuations and portfolio changes. The main contribution to increased orders derived from strong order growth in the Electrification and Robotics & Discrete Automation busi- ness areas. Both Process Automation and Motion contributed with low-single digit growth, with the former impacted by the Accelleron (formerly Turbocharging divi- sion) spin-off in October 2022, while the latter was impacted by the divestment of the Mechanical Power Transmission busi- ness in November 2021.

Customer activity was strong across all regions. Order intake in the Americas in- creased by 19 percent (28 percent com- parable) driven by the United States. Or- ders in Europe developed basically flat at -1 percent (up 13 percent comparable), supported by most larger markets in the region. The Asia, Middle East and Africa region reported an increase of

3 percent (10 percent comparable), in- cluding growth of 1 percent (5 percent comparable) in China.

In 2022, revenues increased by 2 per- cent (12 percent comparable). During the first half of the year, revenues were ham- pered as component constraints some- what hindered customer deliveries. Sup- ply chains, however, progressively eased throughout the year, triggering higher revenue growth rates in the latter part of the year, when excluding the negative impact from exchange rate fluctuations and portfolio changes. All business ar- eas benefitted from increased volumes and strong pricing execution. Electrifica- tion was the largest contributor to ABB's revenue growth with a 7 percent increase (14 percent comparable). Motion and Pro- cess Automation both declined 3 percent (up 14 percent and 7 percent comparable, respectively) due to the adverse impact from the divestment of the Mechanical Power Transmission business in Novem- ber 2021 on the former and the Accel- leron (formerly Turbocharging division) spin-off in October 2022 on the latter. Ro- botics & Discrete Automation reported a moderate revenue decline of 4 percent (up 4 percent comparable), with growth benefiting in the second half of the year as component constraints eased. Overall, the strong order intake for ABB coupled with revenues that were somewhat ham- pered by a strained supply chain, resulted in a positive book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 for the year.

1 Constant currency (not adjusted for portfolio changes).

2 For non-GAAP measures see chap- ter "Alternative per- formance measures".


## Gross profit

Gross profit increased by 3 percent (11 percent in constant currency1) to $9,710 million in 2022, supported by a gross margin improvement of 30 basis points to 33.0 percent. Increases were noted in three out of four business areas, while Robotics & Discrete Automation declined.


### Income from operations

Income from operations in 2022 amoun- ted to $3,337 million down from $5,718 million in the prior year. Results included a charge triggered by the exit of the leg- acy full-train retrofit business in non-core operations as well as a provision related to the legacy Kusile project in South Afri- ca awarded in 2015. Results in 2021 in- cluded a book gain of $2.2 billion related to the divestment of the Mechanical Power Transmission business.


#### Operational EBITA2

In 2022, Operational EBITA improved by 9 percent (18 percent in constant cur- rency) to $4,510 million and the Opera- tional EBITA margin2 increased by 110 ba- sis points to 15.3 percent, achieving the margin target of at least 15 percent one year earlier than expected. Performance was driven by the positive impacts from strong pricing execution and higher vol- umes, which more than offset cost infla- tion in raw materials, freight and labor. Additionally, Corporate and Other Opera- tional EBITA improved by $169 million to -$169 million, partly due to higher real es- tate gains and a better non-core result.

Net finance expenses and non-opera- tional pension credits

The net finance expenses declined $39 million to $58 million in 2022. Non-operational pension credits declined $51 million to $115 million compared to the same period last year.


##### Income tax

Income tax expense was $757 million with a tax rate of 22.3 percent up from 18.3 percent in 2021, due primarily to the adverse impacts from non-deductible non-operational charges as well as a positive impact related to a release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax as- sets due to the improved business per- formance mainly related to the US. In 2021, the tax impacts related to the sale of the Dodge business reduced the effec- tive tax rate by approximately 5 percent.


#### Net income and earnings per share

Net income attributable to ABB was $2,475 million and decreased by 46 per- cent. Basic earnings per share was $1.30 and decreased by 43 percent. Both mea- sures were adversely impacted by the charges triggered by the exit of the leg- acy full-train retrofit business in non- core operations as well as the provision related to the legacy Kusile project in the current year and include a book gain re- lated to the divestment of the Mechani- cal Power Transmission business in 2021.

Balance sheet and cash flow
===

1 For non-GAAP measures, see the "Alternative perfor- mance measures".


## Net working capital

Net working capital amounted to $3,216 million, increasing year-on-year from $2,303 million. The increase mainly re- flects the impact from higher inventories. Net working capital as a percentage of revenues1 increased from 8.1 percent at the end of 2021 to 11.1 percent at the end of 2022.


### Capital expenditures

Purchases of property, plant and equip- ment and intangible assets amounted to $762 million in 2022 compared to $820 million the year before.


### Cash flows

Cash flows from operating activities in continuing operations in 2022 provided net cash of $1,287 million, a decrease of 61 percent compared to 2021 of which 7 percent was due to movements in ex- change rates. In addition, in 2022, we had lower cash effective net income partially due to costs associated with business transformation activities and payments of approximately $315 million in rela- tion to regulatory penalties for the Kusile project. In 2022, an increase in both busi- ness volumes and inflation driven cost and price changes resulted in growth in our working capital.

Free cash flow1 was $652 million, 75 percent lower on a year-on-year ba- sis, and FCF conversion to net income1 27 percent.


## Return on Capital Employed

The Group's benchmark for the measure- ment of returns is Return on Capital

Employed (ROCE)1. The Group's ROCE significantly increased into the 15 to 20 percent target range to 16.5 percent from 14.9 percent in 2021. The improvement was driven by a higher Operational EBITA compared to 2021. The Group's ROCE was negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to the 19.9 percent ownership interest in Hitachi Energy.


### Net debt1

Net debt amounted to $2,779 million at the end of 2022 and increased from a net cash position of $98 million, year-on- year. Net debt to EBITDA ratio increased to 0.67 from (0.01) last year, due primarily to lower cash generation from operating activities in 2022, while we increased our total cash payments to shareholders in the form of dividends and purchases of treasury stock.

Acquisitions

—

During 2022 we accelerated the pace of strategic partnerships as well as bolt-on acquisitions driven by the divisions. Mo- tion announced their first two acquisi- tions in over a decade at combined reve- nues of approximately $125 million. Both the Siemens low voltage NEMA motor business and the PowerTech Converter acquisition will help the respective di- visions to further cement their leading market positions. We have also driven

minority investments through our divi- sional lens. Both the InCharge Energy and Numocity majority acquisitions made earlier this year are good exam- ples that these minority investments can later also become acquisition tar- gets. As part of our future strategy, we continue to aim to complete five or more bolt-on acquisitions each year.

<!-- PageFooter="Divestments" -->

Active portfolio management continues to be part of our performance culture. On the back of systematic portfolio re- views we ascertain whether, ultimately, ABB is the best owner of the different businesses. We continued to make strong progress in aligning our business port- folio with our purpose and fully focus on the areas of electrification and automa- tion. We completed the spin-off of the Turbocharging division in October, and sold the remaining 19.9 percent interest in Hitachi Energy to Hitachi in December 2022. The net cash received from the sale further strengthened our balance sheet, giving us additional flexibility in our cap- ital allocation decisions. After the end of the year, we also reached an agreement in January 2023 to sell our Power Conver- sion division to AcBel Polytech Inc. for $505 million in cash. The transaction

is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.

At the same time, we remain commit- ted to our strategy to separately list our E-mobility business subject to construc- tive market conditions. In the meantime, we received gross proceeds of approxi- mately CHF 200 million through a pri- vate placement of shares in ABB E-Mobil- ity Holding Ltd in November 2022. After the end of the year, we increased the amount of funding raised through the private placement, increasing the total by an additional CHF 325 million in Febru- ary 2023. We remain a committed partner to ABB E-mobility with a shareholding of approximately 81 percent.

Dividends and share buybacks
===

During 2022, ABB distributed a dividend of CHF 0.82 per share to shareholders, totaling $1,700 million. With respect to the year ended December 31, 2022, ABB's Board of Directors has proposed to dis- tribute a dividend to shareholders in the amount of CHF 0.84 per share. This is subject to approval by shareholders at ABB Ltd's 2023 Annual General Meeting. The proposal is in line with the our divi- dend policy to pay a rising, sustainable dividend per share over time.

In April 2022, we launched a new share buyback program of up to $3 billion. As part of this program, we completed the return of the remaining $1.2 billion out of the $7.8 billion of cash proceeds from the Power Grids divestment. Together with the prior share buyback program, which ran from April 2021 to March 2022, we spent approximately a combined $2.8 bil- lion during the year 2022. We plan to con- tinue our share buybacks for the full-year of 2023 in line with our capital allocation priorities to return excess cash to share- holders through buybacks.

Our approach to R&D
===

At ABB, our research and development is focused on developing and commer- cializing technologies that are of stra- tegic importance to our future growth. Every year, we invest a significant pro- portion of our revenues in R&D. As of De- cember 31, 2022, we had approximately 7,500 employees working in R&D centers across more than 30 countries in 6 con- tinents, of which about 60 percent were focused on digital and software develop- ment. 13.5 percent of our R&D profes- sionals are women, an increase of 0.2 percentage points since December 2021, in line with our strategy to increase the share of women in our workforce, includ- ing in technical areas (see also chapter "We promote social progress"). In 2022, we invested $1,166 million or approxi- mately 4.0 percent of our 2022 consoli- dated revenues, in R&D activities in our continuing operations. We also spent

$48 million or approximately 0.2 percent of our 2022 consolidated revenues, on or- der-related development activities. These are customer- and project-specific efforts that we undertake to develop or adapt equipment and systems to the unique needs of our customers in connection with specific orders or projects. We make sig- nificant investments in future-oriented activities and opportunities and spend it wisely according to individual business' needs.

Since 2016, we have invested more than $7.8 billion in R&D representing an an- nual average of 4-5 percent of revenues. R&D spend by division ranges from 1 to 11 percent of revenues, as each division is different and has different investment needs to secure future growth.

<!-- PageHeader="Next chapter" -->

In addition to continuous product development and order-related engineer- ing work, our R&D laboratories develop platforms for technology applications in our businesses. Our main digital platform is ABB Ability™, which is also the brand name of our digital solutions offerings. We seek to maintain a balance between short- and long-term R&D programs and optimize our return on investment. We keep control of our innovations by hold- ing patents, copyrights and other intel- lectual property protections.

To complement our business-focused product development, our businesses in- vest jointly in collaborative research activ- ities covering multiple technology areas including artificial intelligence, software, sensors, control and optimization, mecha- tronics and robotics, power electronics, communication technologies, materials and manufacturing, electrodynamics and electrical switching technologies. In this way, we advance technologies that are used in our products and common tech- nology platforms and apply them to mul- tiple product lines.

Universities are incubators of future technology and one task of our R&D teams is to transform university research projects into industry-ready technology platforms. We collaborate with multiple universities and research institutions to build research networks and foster new technologies. We believe these collabo- rations shorten the amount of time re- quired to turn basic ideas into viable

products. They also help us to recruit and train new personnel. Our university col- laborations include long-term, strategic relationships with leading institutions in the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, India and China.

To enhance our innovation efforts and gain speed, we partner with other leading companies which have complementary competencies and we invest in and col- laborate with start-ups around the world through our venture capital arm, ABB Technology Ventures, and our start-up collaboration hub, SynerLeap. We act as a catalyst to push innovative entrepreneurs to success and bring benefits to ABB cus- tomers and society in the wider sense. In- Charge Energy is a good example, of how initial investments through ABB Techno- logy Ventures can even turn into signifi- cant R&D driven acquisitions. As of Jan- uary 2022 it was incorporated into the ABB family, leveraging synergies for both sides.

Patents and trademarks
===

Intellectual property rights are crucial to protect the assets of our business.

Over the past ten years, we have added a substantial number of new applications to our existing first patent filings and we will continue to seek patent protection for our technologies, products and solu- tions. As of December 31, 2022, we have a portfolio of approximately 25,000 pend- ing patent applications and granted pa- tents, of which approximately 5,500 are pending applications. This portfolio in- cludes approximately 3,500 utility mod- els and design rights, of which approxi- mately 200 are pending applications. In 2022, we filed close to 500 priority pa- tents, utility model and design applica- tions, each covering a unique invention or unique angle on an invention. Based on

our existing intellectual property stra- tegy, we believe that we have adequate control over our core technologies. The "ABB" trademarks and logo are protected in all countries in which we operate. We proactively assert our intellectual pro- perty rights to safeguard the reputation associated with the ABB technology and brand. While these intellectual property rights are fundamental to all our busi- nesses, no business is dependent on any single patent, utility model or design application.

We enable a low-carbon Society
===

The need for action on climate change is becoming ever more urgent.

The hottest years on record have all oc- curred since 1998 and they are increasing in frequency. At the same time, overuse of the earth's resources and environ- mental degradation are jeopardizing the health and future prospects of huge numbers of people around the world.

We are actively helping to reduce green- house gas (GHG) emissions. Our tech- nologies target industry, buildings and transport - sectors that together ac- count for three quarters of global energy consumption. Since the introduction of our ambitious 2030 sustainability tar- gets to enable a low-carbon society, we have already made considerable prog- ress. In 2022, we added mid-term tar- gets 2025 for increased accountability.

We aim to reduce our own emissions (scope 1 and 2) by at least 80 percent by 2030, a target that has been confirmed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as being in line with Paris Agree- ment goal to limit global warming to 1.5℃. Our greenhouse gas accounting methodology is based on the globally accepted GHG Protocol.

Considering the complete life cycle of our products and services, the biggest environmental footprint lies within our extended value chain. Life-cycle assess- ments (LCAs) help us evaluate the car- bon footprint of our products. The big- gest impact is in our downstream value

chain, which is when our products are in use by our customers, followed by our suppliers' footprint in the upstream value chain. Therefore, our ambition is also to help our customers and sup- pliers reduce their GHG emissions. We work intensively on screening, measur- ing and reducing our so-called scope 3 emissions, which represent indirect GHG emissions occurring in our value chain. Examples include emissions from pur- chased goods, business travel or com- muting. Please refer to our Sustainability Report 2022 for more information.

Climate action in our own operations
===

In 2022, we made considerable prog- ress towards our goal of achieving car- bon neutrality in our own operations by 2030. To achieve carbon neutrality, we have committed to three initiatives of the Climate Group of global companies with the aim of reducing our absolute emis- sions as much as possible. By 2030, we will completely electrify our vehicle fleet (EV100 initiative), source 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy sources (RE100 initiative) and improve energy efficiency and productivity across our operations (EP100 initiative). These actions will help us achieve our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction target of

at least 80 percent by 2030. We are ex- ploring further solutions for reducing the remaining 20 percent, with carbon offsets as the last resort. In 2022, we re- duced our total energy consumption by 15 percent compared with 2019. Con- sidering the increased energy costs due to the energy crisis that hit in 2022, this represents also an important cost saving. At the end of 2022, 52 percent of our en- ergy consumption and 81 percent of our electricity was sourced from renewables. Since our baseline year 2019, we have re- duced our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 65 percent.

Supplier emissions
===

\> Further information about how we help to enable a low-carbon society can be found in Sustainability Report 2022.

We announced a new emissions target for our supply chain in 2022. We aim to work with our main tier-one suppliers to achieve a 50 percent reduction in their scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2019. The target covers 70 percent of our annual procurement spend. The new target will make an im- portant contribution to our goal of en- abling a low-carbon society as well as our overall scope 3 emissions reductions be- cause, in many cases, our suppliers have a bigger footprint than ABB itself.

In 2022, we also continued to strengthen ABB's capacity to conduct life-cycle as- sessments (LCAs). These are effective tools for identifying and prioritizing ac- tions with suppliers because they quan- tify how much of the overall emissions footprints of our products are accounted for by raw material sourcing.

Measures to reach our target include:

· incorporating more recycled materials into our products,

· shifting to lower-carbon primary materials, and

· using lower-carbon transport throughout the supply chain, including between different tiers of our direct and indirect suppliers.

As part of achieving our supplier target, we will encourage our suppliers to have their emissions targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and to have their GHG emissions data validated or assured by a third party.

Customer emissions
===

\> For specific exam- ples of products that contribute towards our ambition of sup- porting customers in avoiding GHG emis- sions, see our Sus- tainability Report 2022.

Our biggest contribution to a low-carbon society comes from technologies that re- duce and/or avoid energy consumption and emissions at our customers' opera- tions. As we intend to have our targets validated against the Science Based Tar- gets initiative's new Net-Zero Standard, we are no longer focusing on a limited amount of cases linked to the 100 mega- tons emissions' avoidance but rather on our complete portfolio of offerings.

More and more companies are trying to make a positive impact on society and the environment beyond their own op- erations. However, calculating the re- lated impact of a company's activities or offerings is a challenge, particularly when it comes to avoided emissions, which is a relatively new concept and one in which practices and methodologies vary given the absence of a generally ac- cepted framework. Efforts at harmoni- zation and standardization are currently underway (see the website of GHG Proto- col for more information). Therefore, we are reviewing our approach with the aim of establishing more robust and standar- dized methodologies, based on interna- tional scientific research, to calculate the impact of our products. We will trans- parently communicate about our sta- tus on a regular basis. As part of that process, we are assessing examples of products, services and solutions to help

us achieve our ambition of supporting customers in their GHG emissions re- duction and avoidance. We collaborate closely with our customers to leverage the full benefits of our products and ser- vices. One of the tools we use for these engagements is the EnergySave Calcula- tor, which helps customers calculate how much energy and money they could save by using ABB drives compared to tradi- tional flow control methods in different applications such as pumps, fans and compressors.

We preserve resources

≡

Table of contents

Over the coming decades, the pressure on our environment will increase: today's global pop- ulation of 7.8 billion is expected to expand to 9.7 billion by 2050 according to projections by the United Nations. Some 80 per- cent of people will live in cities, placing enormous burdens on already stretched water, food, energy and transport systems.

To underpin our commitment to preserve resources, we work closely with customers and suppliers and aim to embed circularity across our value chain. Our solutions reduce waste, in- crease recycling and foster reusability.

Circular economy
===

We are working towards aligning our circularity framework with the evolution of external reporting frameworks and regulations, including the EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and GRI Standards. Our goal is to develop a robust, objective, quantitative, measu- rable and auditable framework that cap- tures the true circularity credentials of our product portfolio and we believe that considering external standards will enable

us to better meet the needs of our stake- holders in this respect.

In June 2022, we launched the ABB EcoSolutions label to satisfy our cus- tomers' appetite for externally validated, transparent information on our products' circularity performance. We are steadily increasing the number of environmental product declarations covering selected major product lines.

We aim to refine our circularity approach in line with external regulations in 2023. Thereafter, we will measure our baseline revenue covered by our circularity ap- proach and strengthen our focus on cir- cularity in our strategy.

Our comprehensive circularity approach is built on a framework that drives circular- ity in our own operations, and suppports and enables our suppliers and customers to become more circular. By 2030, we aim to innovate towards new circular business models covering all stages of the product life cycle:

. We consider the entire product life cycle at the design and sourcing stage. Our goal is to develop products and solutions that can be produced in a resource-efficient manner that minimizes the use of virgin or hazardous materials. At the same time, we ensure that our product design takes circularity into account, such as extended lifetime, repairability, modularity and recyclability.

· In the production phase, we work to eliminate or recycle any waste generated by our processes and packaging and implement resource- efficient operations.

. During the use phase of our products, we help our customers maximize the efficiency and lifetime of their equipment.

. At the end of the product lifecycle, we seek to ensure that products can be refurbished whenever possible or dismantled and recycled. Most of the materials used in our products are reclaimable at the end of a product's life and we design our products with this in mind.

Reducing waste
===

\> Further information about how we pre- serve resources can be found in our Sus- tainability Report 2022.

For more than a decade, ABB has been launching intensive waste-reduction and recycling programs at its sites around the world. During 2022, we reduced the amount of waste that ABB generates by 4.8 kilotons to 182 kilotons compared to the previous year. We implemented nearly 60 recycling and waste reduction projects in 2022, that reduced the waste we gener- ate annually by an estimated 700 tons. 86 percent of our waste in 2022 was recycled and 6.7 percent sent to landfill, down from 7.0 percent in the previous year. We now have 159 sites that don't send any waste to landfill, bringing us closer to reaching our target of having zero waste from our operations disposed of in landfills, wher- ever this is compatible with local condi- tions and regulations.

Occupational health and safety
===

Since 2014, ABB has recorded a signifi- cant downward trend in the total num- ber of serious incidents, which shows that our business areas' safety pro- grams are highly effective at reducing or eliminating risky conditions. In 2022, ABB recorded zero workplace related em- ployee fatalities and zero workplace re- lated contractor fatalities. Following our decentralized approach, the divisions take full ownership of their respective

safety programs. Since 2019, the re- corded lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR), defined as work-related injuries that result in at least one day away from work per 200,000 hours worked (equiva- lent to 100 full-time employees per year), has dropped from 0.246 to 0.143. In part, this is due to Covid-19, which resulted in reduced in-person activities.

Diversity and employee engagement
===

At ABB, we are convinced that the di- versity of our workforce and our inclu- sive culture have a positive impact on both our company and the communities in which we operate. We aim to increase diversity across all dimensions, includ- ing gender, LGBTQ+, abilities, ethnicity and generations so that we attract the broadest pool of talent and offer envi- ronments in which everyone can succeed and develop for the long-term success of our people, our business and society as a whole. Global roadmaps and execu- tive sponsorships have been established across all these dimensions to ensure high level commitment and progress.

Our diversity & inclusion (D&I) strategy 2030 is based on three pillars:

· governance that enables an environment of diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities;

· inclusive leadership & culture; and

· partnerships to create awareness and engage with stakeholders both in and outside of ABB.

Our approach goes hand-in-hand with our ABB values of courage, care, curiosity and collaboration.

As part of our global D&I strategy 2030, we aim to increase the proportion of women in senior management to 25 per- cent, which would be a doubling from a

2019 baseline. To improve gender diver- sity across the company, we are work- ing on increasing the share of women in our early talent hires. In recent years, we were able to increase the proportion of women in senior management positions and the workforce overall.

To foster a more diverse, fair and inclu- sive workplace, we also supported the growth of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are voluntary, employee- led groups that champion diversity initia- tives at ABB.

As part of our commitment to further promote social progress and diversity and inclusion, in 2022, ABB adopted the United Nations (UN) Women's Empower- ment Principles, adding to our broad partnerships to embrace difference and foster inclusion.

As announced in 2022, ABB will be strengthening gender diversity on its Board of Directors by proposing one ad- ditional female member for election to the Board at its annual general meeting 2023.

To drive and support an inclusive corpo- rate culture, we conduct a continuous and open dialogue with our employees through various initiatives and engage- ments, such as Pride Month and our ABB Sustainability Changemaker Award (see below).

In ABB's 2022 employee Engagement Sur- vey, our employee engagement score was 76 out of 100, compared with scores of 74 in 2021, 75 in 2020 and 71 in 2019. The response rate reached a record high level of 82 percent with 85,878 employees tak- ing part, thanks largely to engaging more production employees.

We partner with Glint Inc. to benchmark ourselves against our peers. Our aim is to achieve a top-tier engagement score. Overall, we have made steady progress since the survey's launch in 2019, when many of our scores were significantly be- low the benchmark. In 2022, we scored 1 point above benchmark. We received strong scores for safety, integrity, role clarity, communication and accountabil- ity. We received a lot of comments and constructive feedback through the sur- vey. To drive engagement, we will con- tinue to empower our divisions and focus on making ABB an even better place to work.

ABB Sustainability Changemaker Award

One way in which we engaged our employees was to give them the oppor- tunity to play a part in driving and sup- porting sustainable development at ABB. In 2021, the ABB Sustainability Change- maker Award invited employees to sub- mit ideas or innovations to help us meet our sustainability goals. In total, 223 en- tries were received from teams around the world. In a semifinalist preselection, 12 innovative projects covering all of our four sustainability pillars were assessed. The winners were announced at ABB's an- nnual gathering of senior managers, the Group Leadership Forum, in June 2022. Named "Sustainable/circular plastic solu- tions for products and their packaging",

the winning entry was chosen for its approach of substituting conventional plastics with recycled or bio-based ma- terials. The solution has the potential to reduce emissions attributed to plastics in ABB products and packaging by two thirds. In addition to the award, the win- ning team will receive all necessary sup- port from ABB to realize the solution. Over 10 use cases related to various products and their packaging are being worked on in close collaboration with our divisions. Some have already successfully passed the pilot phase and in one case related to 100 percent recycled PET, it has already been implemented.

Human rights
===

\> Further information about how we pro- mote social progress can be found in our Sustainability Report 2022.

\> Further information about how we en- sure sustainability across our extended value chain can be found in the chapter "Third-party manage- ment and responsible sourcing".

ABB places great emphasis on respecting human rights in its business as well as in the extended value chain. In 2022, as part of our five-year human rights plan until 2025, we re-assessed our salient human rights risks and conducted a high level, system- atic review of our human rights due dili- gence framework. This will be followed in 2023 by business specific reviews of risks and due diligence processes as well as ex- ternal stakeholder engagement to validate our conclusions. Based on the results of our 2021 pilot program, we also updated our human rights self-assessment protocol and continued to conduct self-assessments at selected ABB sites. In total, 58 sites in 25 countries undertook assessments in 2022. We also continued to train our employees on human rights topics to make sure that awareness, identification, mitigation and avoidance of human rights risks are em- bedded in our daily operations. In total, 4,687 employees completed general human rights e-learning courses, and we provided targeted trainings for management and job roles specifically exposed to human rights risks.

For the past several years, we have also is- sued a yearly Modern Slavery Statement pursuant to the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018. Risks related to modern slavery and human trafficking are specifically ad- dressed in our training programs and as- sessment protocols. During 2022, three cases of working conditions that could in- volve modern slavery at ABB suppliers were reported via our business ethics helpline. No allegations have been substantiated; two of these cases were still under investi- gation at the close of the year.

ABB has well-established internal report- ing and allegation management processes to deal with alleged violations of our Code of Conduct, including matters relating to human rights. Our allegation management team aims to listen attentively and respond swiftly to employee concerns and manage a fair justice adjudication process aligned with our values. Work continues to enhance employee trust in our integrity and re- porting program for concerns of potential non-compliance with our Code of Conduct to be reported in a timely manner.

Following the introduction of our ABB Way operating model in 2020, various workplace enhancements were launched, including an open job market, new leadership learn- ing ecosystems, innovations in our integrity learning and speak-up culture, and messag- ing regarding the use of our business eth- ics helpline to report suspected cases of non-compliance with our Code of Conduct.

Following this progress, in 2021 we launched "Straight Talk", a learning plat- form that uses real cases that we have faced and continue to face as an organi- zation to share knowledge and continu- ous learning to strengthen our culture of integrity.

Among the key messages that were im- parted to employees, were the necessity of reporting all potential cases of non- compliance with the Code of Conduct to our business ethics helpline, and a focus on driving safety in reporting to build confi- dence in our zero tolerance for retaliation risk.

As a result, we have seen greater employee engagement in the use of our learning tools intended to drive heightened integrity awareness.

Community engagement
===

As part of our 2030 sustainability strategy, we provide impactful sup- port for community-building initiatives around the world, focused on: educa- tion, diversity and inclusion, and care in the community. In 2022, we supported more than 400 projects and charities in 40 countries with over $10 million of donations and 4,050 person days of vol- unteer work. To support the humani- tarian effort in Ukraine, we contributed more than CHF 2.2 million in employee and Group donations to the response campaign of the International Commit- tee of the Red Cross. Some ABB employ- ees travelled to the borders of Ukraine to transport people fleeing the country to a safe place, while others donated es- sentials like food and warm clothing to

refugees through company-organized evacuations and aid initiatives.

In 2022, we also continued our strong focus on science, technology, engineer- ing, and mathematics (STEM) education through a variety of projects across the world. These included providing finan- cial support for underprivileged stu- dents, promoting diversity and inclu- sion in STEM education and enhancing technical skills through training courses and access to the latest technology. ABB employees in many regions also volunteered their time for mentoring programs to support students from ele- mentary school through to university level.

| do business in an ethical way | a safe and sustainable way | trust with all stakeholders | ABB's assets and reputation | and do not retaliate |

The Integrity & Regulatory Affairs team, which sits within the Legal & Integrity function, is responsible for driving core enhancements across ABB, which collec- tively form our ongoing integrity trans- formation under our ABB Way operat- ing model. These enhancements extend across all ABB functions and our four business areas, setting an integrity pro- gram which is comprehensive, adaptive to risk in real time and overall fit-for-pur- pose. At its core, ABB's Global Integrity Program has three objectives. Firstly, to appropriately and thoroughly reme- diate integrity-related risks identified through root-cause analysis and test- ing and monitoring activities. Secondly, to enhance our internal controls, with emphasis on our anti-bribery and anti- corruption program and to verify the efficacy of our controls through test- ing. Thirdly, to assess and enhance our workplace culture through on-going and

targeted integrity-focused self-learn- ing and awareness to drive behavior accountability.

As part of this self-learning and aware- ness process, we continue to promote on a monthly basis our "Straight Talk" case library, a dedicated internal plat- form where we share integrity learnings, both successes and failures, from real- life cases that ABB (or another major or- ganization) has faced. We complement these learnings with readily available data on active or recent investigations, giving greater transparency to what our investigations portfolio looks like in terms of risks and trends, the types of reports made, the geographies con- cerned and the methods of reporting used by employees.

The allegations reported in 2022 were categorized into the following categories (as well as more detailed subcategories within each of these) to ensure appro- priate attention, resourcing and internal escalation:

· Antitrust & Fair Competition

· Bribery benefiting ABB

· Commercial integrity & Regulatory

· Fraud: Non-Self-Dealing

· Fraud: Self-Dealing

· HSE & Security

· Human Resources

· Non-Integrity Issue

. Other Integrity Issue

In 2022, the following employment actions - in addition to myriad, non- disciplinary remedial actions - resulted from integrity violations pursuant to ABB's root-cause analysis and account- ability processes:

· 36 verbal warnings

. 116 written warnings

. 135 employment separations

· 4 demotions, suspensions or other financial penalties

Our internal investigations framework re- quires that investigations follow due pro- cess and that any employment actions are measured, appropriate, and reached in consultation with appropriate ABB management.

<!-- PageFooter="compliance program" -->

ABB's antitrust compliance program is an established program which is evalu- ated on a regular basis to respond to le- gal and regulatory developments, to ad- vances in globally recognized compliance "best practices" and to learnings from ABB's own investigations. It is supported by ABB's Board of Directors and senior executives and driven by a team of ded- icated antitrust experts. The program's rules are set forth in a suite of policies, procedures, and internal controls specif- ically addressing ABB's antitrust risks. These are integrated into ABB's culture and internal controls through dedicated training of legal and business communi- ties, the provision of specific expert an- titrust advice as well as regular internal

exchange forums to raise awareness of antitrust topics of relevance to our operations.

Our antitrust experts work closely with our colleagues responsible for ABB's business ethics helpline to facilitate the identification, investigation and reme- diation of any antitrust concerns. Im- portantly, a strong antitrust ethos per- meates ABB's mergers & acquisitions activity, including through the perfor- mance of due diligence prior to invest- ments, acquisitions or joint ventures, to support healthy and compliant company growth.

ABB has a "zero tolerance" policy towards unethical business behavior. Whether it is bribery, corruption, forced labor or other improper business practices, our Code of Conduct is clear: improper payments and arrangements are illegal and we do not accept or tolerate these business prac- tices, whether with public officials or with private sector business partners.

In 2022, we rolled out new Anti-Bribery & Anti-Corruption (ABAC) upskilling for em- ployees in gatekeeper functions and cus- tomer facing roles across ABB to enhance core ABAC competencies and to highlight the crucial role these employees play in ensuring ABB's sustainable and compet- itive future. We also launched version 2.0 of our Integrity Gateway, a global and now centralized tool for all employee- related requests for Gifts, Travel & Hos- pitality, Donations & Sponsorships and the disclosure and management of Con- flicts of Interest. These enhancements are significant developments in the way we monitor and manage ABAC risks that third parties pose to ABB.

On December 2, 2022, we announced that ABB had reached a full and final settle- ment with the National Director of Pub- lic Prosecution in South Africa, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Securi- ties and Exchange Commission, and the Office of the Attorney General of Swit- zerland, for their investigations into im- proper business practices by ABB on the legacy Kusile project in South Africa awarded in 2015.

We have taken, and continue to take, ex- tensive actions to enhance our culture of integrity, including:

. Comprehensively remediating the root causes of the conduct, firstly through internal control enhancements at the local level where they occurred, and secondly through global process enhancements;

· Applying learnings to drive company- wide cultural changes and individual accountability for integrity; and

· Innovating ABB's monitoring and testing activities and the platforms/ tools we use for strong risk management and integrity assurance.

Our work does not stop here; we con- tinue to work, innovate and enhance our integrity program, to have controls, pro- cesses and a culture that are effective de- terrents of bribery and corruption. Integ- rity is not a static concept and nor is our integrity program which underpins it.

Reporting channels for integrity related

concerns

A speak-up culture is critical for a sus- tainable business. It is led by our tone from the top, which enables us to drive regular communications and awareness to all employees that reporting integ- rity concerns must be championed and encouraged.

We do this through multiple internal platforms, including quarterly integrity topics shared in team meetings, sharing learnings from cases past and present and having middle and senior management delivering this messaging via various media. We have five estab- lished reporting channels for integrity concerns and actively promote these across all four of our business areas.

Third-party management and responsible sourcing
===

The standard that we expect from our third parties is simple - that they share our ethical standards. We continue to advance ABB's commitment to having a supply base that is sustainable and that sustainability as a whole remains firmly at the center of our approach to how we conduct business. In 2022, we launched an enhanced "Third Party Management" (TPM) program and associated global roll-out of enhanced on- boarding and monitoring processes across ABB. Focusing initially on our suppliers (buy-side) and sales channels (sell-side),

these enhancements take a risk-based ap- proach to due diligence and selecting ap- propriate third parties that we do business with or that act on our behalf, to enable more effective oversight and monitoring of their activities and overall performance and business value to ABB. During the course of 2023, we will extend the appli- cation of the enhanced TPM program and processes to our existing third party popu- lation further enhancing our ongoing man- agement of third-party risk.

With respect to our supply chain, 22 percent of our spend on high-risk suppliers in focus countries was covered by our Sustainable Supply Base Management program by the end of 2022, and 87 percent of identified risks were closed. Plans are in place to achieve our medium-term target by 2025.

As part of our longstanding program to monitor the supplier sustainability perfor- mance, in 2022 we assessed 58 suppliers on site and mitigated 87 percent of identified risks. These often relate to working prac- tices and safety, lack of risk management, controls and reporting, and sub-suppliers management. In 7 cases, ABB had to termi- nate the relationships with suppliers in 2022 due to unsatisfactory progress on their cor- rective action plans. Three cases of work- ing conditions that could involve modern slavery at ABB suppliers were reported via our business ethics helpline. No allegations have been substantiated; two of these cases were still under investigation at the close of the year. During the year, we rolled out an updated supplier onboarding process

that better embeds sustainability and hu- man rights topics in supplier selection and qualification procedures. We also completed the review of our Supplier Code of Conduct to clarify our commitments in certain key areas and to address changes in the regula- tory environment since the last revision. The updated Code will be rolled out in early 2023 along with other enhancements to supplier qualification processes. In other activities related to responsible sourcing, we trained 26 ABB employees and 54 suppliers in the course of the year on applying the principles of the ABB Supplier Code of Conduct.

Special focus is also given to responsible sourcing of minerals, underpinned by the ABB Policy on Conflict Minerals. We are a member of the Responsible Minerals Initia- tive (RMI) which works to encourage smelt- ers and refiners to undergo audits aligned with OECD guidelines to increase the trans- parency of conflict minerals in our supply chain. On an annual basis, we report on this critical worldwide sustainability issue in our Conflict Minerals Report.

Sustainability incentives
===

\> Further information about remuneration and incentives can be found in the "Com- pensation summary" in this report and in the separate Com- pensation Report 2022.

\> More information about how we create a culture of integ- rity and transparency along the extended value chain can be found in our Sustain- ability Report 2022.

Sustainability goals are linked to senior management variable pay to help incen- tivize and recognize the achievements of our sustainability targets. This in turn contributes to employee engagement and their identification with our purpose, as well as closer alignment with the ex- pectations of our other stakeholders, in- cluding investors, regulators, customers and suppliers.

Beginning in 2022, all Executive Com- mittee (EC) members had at least two sustainability-related goals (e.g., GHG emissions reduction, safety, female lead- ership) in the individual component of the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP), while a corporate sustainability goal with a weighting of 20 percent has been added to the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which is offered to all EC members and senior management population of around 100 employees. The goal applied to the LTIP for the performance period 2022-2024 relates to scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emission reductions, compared to a 2019 baseline.

ABB is committed to the highest international standards of corpo- rate governance. This is reinforced in its structure, processes and rules, as outlined in more detail in ABB's Corporate Governance Report.

ABB complies with all relevant frame- works, including the Swiss Code of Obli- gations, the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance and the rules of the capital markets where its shares are listed. Governance principles are also anchored in various ABB corporate docu- ments, such as its Articles of Incorpora- tion and its Board Governance Rules.

Strong corporate governance is not only necessary to ensure compliance with ap- plicable legal requirements, but also rep- resents a solid basis for creating sus- tainable value. We are convinced that our established governance culture helps ABB successfully manage its business and realize opportunities for the benefit of all of its shareholders. This applies in particular to sustainability. ABB has a ro- bust sustainability governance structure from its Board of Directors through to its operating divisions.

Board of Directors
===

ABB's Board of Directors is re- sponsible for the strategy of the company. It is a truly diverse board: seven of its ten members have been elected in the past six years and all of them represent a broad variety of geographical, business, management and cultural experience.

While the Board takes decisions as a whole, its three committees - the Finance, Audit and Compliance Com- mittee, the Governance and Nomina- tion Committee and the Compensation Committee - support it with high-level

expertise and by ensuring an efficient mode of operation. Special attention is paid to sustainability aspects: oversight of ABB's corporate social responsibility (including health, safety and environment as well as sustainability) is the responsi- bility of the Governance and Nomination Committee. The Compensation Commit- tee ensures that sustainability-related key performance indicators are embed- ded in the compensation schemes for ABB's Executive Committee. Ultimate responsibility for ABB's sustainability strategy, its sustainability targets and its annual Sustainability Report lies with the entire Board of Directors.

Each member of the Executive Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors. The Board has delegated the executive manage- ment of ABB to the CEO, who - together with the other members of the Executive Committee - is responsible for the company's operational business.

In line with the Board's leading example, ABB's Executive Committee strives to be equally diverse, not only in business and management experience, but also when it comes to geographical and cultural backgrounds.

changes for 2023


## Disclosure

As in previous years, the Compensation Comittee has listened carefully to inputs and suggestions from our stakeholders re- lated to potential improvements to disclo- sure and has progressively moved to adopt- ing leading market practices.

In response to this feedback, the Annual In- centive Plan (AIP) targets for the CEO, start- ing in 2023, will be retrospectively disclosed in the following year's Compensation Re- port (thus for the first time in 2024). This will represent a relevant additional level of transparency on the alignment between

pay and performance that we seek to en- sure at ABB.


## Termination Provisions under the AIP

For new joiners to the Executive Committee (EC), we also plan to amend the termina- tion provisions under our AIP to be broadly aligned with the termination provisions un- der the LTIP. This will specifically include, in the event of resignation, the full forfeiture of the AIP award if the last day of employ- ment is prior to the end of the performance period (i.e., 31 December of the relevant performance year).

Sustainability

impact in executive

compensation

Following valuable stakeholder feedback, we will maintain the strong link between our sustainability strategy and compen- sation programs, such that all EC mem- bers will continue to have a sustainability measure in their Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), with a material weighting of 20 percent. In addition, all EC members

shall continue to have at least two sustain- ability related goals in the individual com- ponent of their AIP.

The sustainability targets for both the 2022 and 2023 LTIP relate to our long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduc- tion ambitions, which are prospectively dis- closed in the Compensation Report 2022.

2022 was a year of solid performance, de- spite supply chain, logistics and labor chal- lenges, rising inflation and the energy cri- sis in Europe. Overall, most key financial, sustainability and operational targets were met or excelled. ABB delivered a strong

Board of Directors: the aggregate Board compensation for the 2022-2023 term (CHF 4.38 million) is in line with the maximum amount (CHF 4.4 million) ap- proved at the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM). There has been no change to the in- dividual Board fees since 2015.

Executive Committee: the aggregate EC total compensation was CHF 36.0 million in 2022, compared to CHF 39.2 million in 2021, and in line with the maximum amount (CHF 40 million) approved at the 2021 AGM.

Five of the nine EC members in place re- ceived a salary adjustment in March 2022, which ranged from 2.1 to 12.5 percent, for exceptional performance, market adjust- ment or broadening of responsibilities. This corresponded to an average 3.25 percent increase on the annual aggregate

At the annual general meeting (AGM) on March 23, 2023, shareholders will be asked to vote on the maximum aggregate com- pensation for the Board for its 2023-2024 term and on the maximum aggregate com- pensation for the EC in 2024. The former is again unchanged compared to the prior year, while the latter shows a reduction from the level requested for last year due to

operational EBITA margin, increased its rev- enues and orders, and improved productiv- ity in 2022. In addition, the company made significant progress in reducing its envi- ronmental footprint and contributing to a more sustainable environment.

base salaries for EC members in post in March 2022.

The average award for the current EC mem- bers under the AIP for 2022 was 118.3 percent (out of a maximum 150 percent), compared to 143.4 percent in 2021. This outcome was driven by a strong perfor- mance from the majority of the businesses as well as strong progress on sustainability related and other strategic targets.

The average weighted achievement level of the 2019 LTIP, which vested in 2022, was 121.0 percent (out of a maximum 200 percent), driven primarily by a maximum vesting under the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance measure.

lower potential vesting related costs from the 2021 LTIP award, as well as the lower compensation levels applied to new EC members compared to plan.

The Compensation Report 2022 will also be submitted for a non-binding, consultative vote by shareholders.

Realized variable compensation considers the AIP award and the LTIP award at the end of their respective performance cy- cles, reflecting actual AIP payment and LTIP vesting, based on achievement of the respective plan performance measures.

The outcome of the 2022 AIP was above the target for most of the current EC members (118.3 percent on average), and the LTIP that vested in 2022 (2019 LTIP) exceeded the target level, with a final vesting level of 121.0 percent of target.

EC members may not sell their shares (except to meet tax and social security costs) until they achieve the required shareholding level.

Four out of nine EC members have al- ready met and exceeded their share own- ership requirement. Two other members are close to achieving their requirement,

while three members have been ap- pointed to the EC in the last two years.

When considering the number of granted, but unvested, ABB shares of cur- rent EC members as per December 31, 2022, it is expected that most will meet or exceed their share ownership require- ment in 2023, after vesting of the 2020 LTIP grant.

Sustainability considerations in ABB's compensation
===

There are several sustainability related considerations, that play an important role in our compensation philosophy, of which one is to foster the link between

<figure>

![](figures/222)

<!-- FigureContent="Impact of sustainability performance on variable compensation" -->

</figure>


One of the main subjects of the Com- pensation Committee's recent decisions was to reinforce the link of ABB's sustain- ability strategy - and its associated am- bitious targets for 2030 - to ABB's key variable compensation programs AIP and LTIP. These decisions resulted in a suite of changes which we believe keep ABB in line with leading compensation market practices and reinforce our commitment towards sustainability and long-term value creation.

With regard to the AIP, ABB recently en- larged the mandatory inclusion of sus- tainability performance measures in the individual component of the relevant AIP for its executives and further employees in the organization. All EC members have two or more sustainability related goals (out of maximum three) in the individ- ual component of their AIP. While all EC members had an environment target in 2022, business area Presidents had a safety goal, the CFO a governance goal

the sustainability performance measures under our sustainability strategy and the variable compensation for our EC and se- nior management.

and other corporate officers had a social goal, on top of the environment goal.

In regard to the LTIP granted to ABB's senior management, including the EC, a sustainability measure with a weighting of 20 percent forms part of the perfor- mance measures.

· For the 2022 LTIP, the sustainability measure was the company's scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction at the end of the three-year performance period (2022-2024), compared to the 2019 baseline.

· The 2022 sustainability measure has also been applied to 2023 LTIP, namely scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction at the end of the three-year performance period (2023-2025), compared to the 2019 baseline.

· Details of the long-term GHG emissions reduction targets can be found in the Sustainability Report 2022.

Alternative performance measures
===

The following are definitions of key fi- nancial measures used to evaluate ABB's operating performance. These financial measures are referred to in this Annual Report and are not defined under United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).

While ABB's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures herein are useful in evaluating ABB's operating results, this information should be con- sidered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related finan- cial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.


## Comparable growth rates

Growth rates for certain key figures may be presented and discussed on a "com- parable" basis. The comparable growth rate measures growth on a constant cur- rency basis. Since we are a global com- pany, the comparability of our operating results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluc- tuations. We calculate the impacts from foreign currency fluctuations by trans- lating the current-year periods' reported key figures into U.S. dollar amounts using the exchange rates in effect for the com- parable periods in the previous year.

Comparable growth rates are also ad- justed for changes in our business port- folio. Adjustments to our business port- folio occur due to acquisitions,

divestments, or by exiting specific busi- ness activities or customer markets. The adjustment for portfolio changes is cal- culated as follows: where the results of any business acquired or divested have not been consolidated and reported for the entire duration of both the current and comparable periods, the reported key figures of such business are adjusted to exclude the relevant key figures of any corresponding quarters which are not comparable when computing the com- parable growth rate. Certain portfolio changes which do not qualify as divest- ments under U.S. GAAP have been treated in a similar manner to divestments.

Changes in our portfolio where we have exited certain business activities or cus- tomer markets are adjusted as if the rele- vant business was divested in the period when the decision to cease business ac- tivities was taken. We do not adjust for portfolio changes where the relevant business has annualized revenues of less than $50 million.

\> For a full recon- ciliation of ABB's non-GAAP measures, please refer to "Sup- plemental Reconcilia- tions and Definitions" in the "ABB Q4 2022 Financial Informa- tion" (https://global. abb/group/en/inves- tors/results-and-re- ports/2022).

## Operational EBITA margin


## Operational EBITA margin

Operational EBITA margin is Operational EBITA as a percentage of Operational revenues.


## Operational EBITA

Operational earnings before interest, taxes and acquisition-related amortiza- tion (Operational EBITA) represents In- come from operations excluding:

· acquisition-related amortization (as defined below),

· restructuring, related and implementation costs (as defined below),

· changes in the amount recorded for obligations related to divested businesses occurring after the divestment date (changes in obligations related to divested businesses),

· changes in estimates relating to opening balance sheets of acquired businesses (changes in pre-acquisition estimates),

· gains and losses from sale of businesses (including fair value adjustment on assets and liabilities held for sale),

· acquisition- and divestment-related expenses and integration costs,

· other income/expense relating to the Power Grids joint venture,

· certain other non-operational items, as well as

· foreign exchange/commodity timing differences in income from operations consisting of: (a) unrealized gains and losses on derivatives (foreign exchange, commodities, embedded derivatives), (b) realized gains and losses on derivatives where the underlying hedged transaction has not yet been realized, and (c) unrealized foreign exchange movements on receivables/ payables (and related assets/liabilities).

Certain other non-operational items gen- erally includes: certain regulatory, compli- ance and legal costs, certain asset write downs/impairments (including impair- ment of goodwill) and certain other fair value changes, as well as other items which are determined by management on a case-by-case basis.

Operational EBITA is our measure of seg- ment profit but is also used by manage- ment to evaluate the profitability of the Company as a whole.


## Acquisition-related amortization

Amortization expense on intangibles arising upon acquisitions.

Restructuring, related and implemen- tation costs

Restructuring, related and implementa- tion costs consists of restructuring and other related expenses, as well as internal and external costs relating to the imple- mentation of group-wide restructuring programs.


### Other income/expense relating to the Power Grids joint venture

Other income/expense relating to the Power Grids joint venture consists of amounts recorded in Income from con- tinuing operations before taxes relating to the divested Power Grids business including the income/loss under the equity method for the investment in Hitachi Energy Ltd. (Hitachi Energy), amortization of deferred brand income as well as changes in value of other obli- gations relating to the divestment.


## Operational revenues

We present Operational revenues solely for the purpose of allowing the com- putation of Operational EBITA margin. Operational revenues are total reve- nues adjusted for foreign exchange/

<!-- PageNumber="202" -->

<!-- PageHeader="ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2022 APPENDIX" -->

commodity timing differences in total revenues of: (i) unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, (ii) realized gains and losses on derivatives where the underlying hedged transaction has not yet been realized, and (iii) unrealized foreign exchange movements on receiv- ables (and related assets). Operational revenues are not intended to be an alter- native measure to Total Revenues, which represent our revenues measured in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Net working capital as a percent- age of revenues


## Net working capital as a percentage of revenues

Net working capital as a percentage of revenues is calculated as Net working capital divided by Adjusted revenues for the trailing twelve months.


## Net working capital

Net working capital is the sum of (i) receivables, net, (ii) contract assets, (iii) inventories, net, and (iv) prepaid ex- penses; less (v) accounts payable, trade, (vi) contract liabilities (including non- current amounts) and (vii) other current liabilities (excluding primarily: (a) income taxes payable, (b) current derivative liabilities, (c) pension and other em- ployee benefits, (d) payables under the share buyback program, (e) liabilities related to certain other restructuring- related activities and (f) liabilities related to the divestment of the Power Grids business); and including the amounts related to these accounts which have been presented as either assets or liabilities held for sale but excluding any amounts included in discontinued operations.


## Adjusted revenues for the trailing twelve months

Adjusted revenues for the trailing twelve months includes total revenues recorded by ABB in the twelve months preceding the relevant balance sheet date adjusted to eliminate revenues of divested busi- nesses and the estimated impact of annualizing revenues of certain acquisitions which were completed in the same trailing twelve-month period.

Free cash flow conversion to net income


### Free cash flow conversion to net income

Free cash flow conversion to net income is calculated as free cash flow divided by Adjusted net income attributable to ABB.


## Adjusted net income attributable to ABB

Adjusted net income attributable to ABB is calculated as net income attributable to ABB adjusted for: (i) impairment of goodwill, (ii) losses from extinguishment of debt, and (iii) gains arising on the sale of the equity-accounted investment in Hitachi Energy Ltd., the Mechanical Power Transmission division (Dodge) and the Power Grids business, the latter being included in discontinued operations.


### Free cash flow

Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for: (i) purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and (ii) proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.

Return on Capital employed (ROCE)


## Return on Capital employed

Return on Capital employed is calculated as Operational EBITA after tax, divided by the average of the period's opening and closing Capital employed, adjusted to reflect impacts from the timing of signif- icant acquisitions/divestments occurring during the period.


## Capital employed

Capital employed is calculated as the sum of Adjusted total fixed assets and Net working capital (as defined above).


### Adjusted total fixed assets

Adjusted total fixed assets is the sum of (i) property, plant and equipment, net, (ii) goodwill, (iii) other intangible assets, net, (iv) investments in equity-accounted companies, and (v) operating lease right- of-use assets, less (vi) deferred tax liabili- ties recognized in certain acquisitions.


## Notional tax on Operational EBITA

The Notional tax on Operational EBITA is computed using an adjusted group effective tax rate multiplied by Opera- tional EBITA.


### Adjusted Group effective tax rate

The Adjusted Group effective tax rate is computed by dividing an adjusted income tax expense by an adjusted pre- tax income. Certain amounts recorded in income before taxes and the related income tax expense (primarily due to gains and losses from sale of businesses and in 2022, regulatory penalties in con- nection with the Kusile project) are removed from the reported amounts when computing these adjusted amounts. Certain other amounts recorded in income tax expense are also excluded from the computation to determine the Adjusted Group effective tax rate.

Net debt


## Net debt

Net debt is defined as Total debt less Cash and marketable securities.

Total debt

Total debt is the sum of Short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt, and Long-term debt.


### Cash and marketable securities

Cash and marketable securities is the sum of Cash and equivalents, Restricted cash (current and non-current) and Marketable securities and short-term investments.

Net debt/EBITDA ratio

Net debt/EBITDA ratio

Net debt/EBITDA ratio is defined as Net debt (as defined aboce) divided by EBITDA.

EBITDA

EBITDA is defined as Income from operations for the trailing twelve months preceding the balance sheet date before depreciation and amortization for the same trailing twelve-month period.

Net finance expenses

Net finance expenses is calculated as Interest and dividend income less Interest and other finance expense.

Book-to-bill ratio

Book-to-bill ratio is calculated as Orders received divided by Total revenues.

Key terms
===


## A


## ABB Way

The ABB Way is the common operating model for our divisions, business ar- eas and lean corporate center. It defines "how" we create value. It is built around our purpose and consists of four ele- ments: business model, people & culture, brand and governance.


## B


### Business areas

ABB has a decentralized business model with of 20 divisions grouped into four business areas: Electrification, Motion, Process Automation and Robotics & Discrete Automation. They complement each other, cooperate and find synergies to create competitive advantages and best serve our customers.


## C


## Capitals

We rely on six types of resources and re- lationships, the so-called "capitals" as referenced in the Integrated Reporting (<IR>) Framework, to run our business and be successful: financial capital, in- tellectual capital, natural capital, man- ufactured capital, human capital, and social & relationship capital. They are the inputs that enable us to create value in the short, medium and long term. Through our business activities, we cre- ate outputs and outcomes, which in turn

increase, decrease or transform the capi- tals. Because the capital flows are inter- connected, we seek to balance and in- crease them overall.


### Circular economy

In contrast to a linear "take-make-waste" model of production and consumption, the circular economy aims to keep resources in use by designing products for durability, reusability and recyclabil- ity. At ABB, circular economy approaches are at the center of the second pillar of our sustainability strategy, "Preserving resources". By 2030, we aim to have at least 80 percent of ABB's products and solutions covered by our circularity approach and evaluated against a clear set of key performance indicators (KPIs), corresponding to each stage of the prod- uct lifecycle.


## Creating a culture of integrity & transparency along the extended value chain

The fourth pillar of our sustainability strategy 2030 aims to embed integrity and transparency across our value chain. Our Code of Conduct is binding on all employees and forms the basis for inter- actions with projects and counterparties. As well as our global integrity program, we have defined targets for mitigating third-party and supplier risks and we are including our sustainability targets in our senior management incentives.

<!-- PageHeader="Previous chapter" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Table of contents" -->


## D


## Divisions

Our 20 divisions represent the highest level of operating decisions within ABB with full ownership and accountability for their respective strategies, performance and resources, as they are closest to the markets. They are grouped into four busi- ness areas.


## E


### Enabling a low-carbon society

The first pillar of our sustainability strat- egy 2030 is where we can make the big- gest contribution to a more sustainable society. We have set 2030 and 2025 tar- gets to reduce GHG emissions along our value chain.


## G


### Greenhouse gas emissions

GHG emissions refer to all emissions that have a warming effect on the earth's sur- face by trapping heat in the atmosphere. The Kyoto Protocol defines the follow- ing six greenhouse gases: carbon diox- ide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), the so-called F-gases (hydroflu- orocarbons and perfluorocarbons) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are released during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil or natural gas. All GHG emissions can be calculated as CO2-equivalents (CO2e), which is the metric measure that we use at ABB to calculate our overall emissions

and progress towards our emissions re- duction targets.


## H


## Headcount

Headcount represents the number of people employed at ABB and is notably used in social reporting. It differs from FTE (or Full-Time Equivalent) which rep- resents the number of worked hours compared to a full-time employee; FTE is notably used in financial reporting. For example, a full-time employee is considered as 1 headcount and 1 FTE whereas a part-time employee is consid- ered as 1 headcount and less than 1 FTE.


## M Materiality/material topics

Materiality refers to the process of iden- tifying the most important topics to be managed and included in reporting. ABB's material sustainability topics were identified in 2020 through a compre- hensive stakeholder engagement pro- cess. Based on this analysis, we present an overview of material topics for value creation in the chapter "Material topics". We are currently working on further en- hancing our double materiality approach through stakeholder engagement by con- sidering both the impact that ABB has on the environment and society, and the im- pact that material topics have on ABB's business success.

## N Net-zero vs. carbon neutral

"Net-zero" means that any carbon diox- ide released into the atmosphere is bal- anced by an equivalent amount being removed. "Carbon neutral" means that carbon emissions can be offset by a re- duction in emissions or a removal of car- bon from the atmosphere, for instance through carbon sinks, which absorb more carbon than they emit. To achieve net-zero or carbon neutrality, companies can buy carbon credits to cover the emis- sions they cannot eliminate. At ABB, we aim to achieve carbon neutrality in our own operations by 2030, and net-zero value chain GHG emissions by 2050.


## P


### Preserving resources

The second pillar of our sustainability strategy 2030 aims to preserve resources by moving to circular business models that cut waste, increase recyclability and reusability, and make our products more durable. We work closely with customers and suppliers and aim to embed circular- ity across our value chain.


#### Promoting social progress

The third pillar of our sustainability strat- egy 2030 is centered on promoting social progress in the workplace and beyond. We build safe, fair and inclusive working environments where our people can suc- ceed and develop while promoting social progress across our value chain. We aim at being a top-tier employer and care for the communities where we live and work.


## Purpose

ABB's purpose is to enable a more sus- tainable and resource-efficient future with our technology leadership in electri- fication and automation. This is why we are in business and is the guiding star for ABB's direction and strategy. It is based on the five themes of: creating success for all our stakeholders, addressing the world's energy challenges, transform- ing industries, embedding sustainabil- ity in everything we do and leading with technology.


## S


### Scope 1 GHG emissions

Direct emissions from company-owned and controlled resources, for example, emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc.


## Scope 2 GHG emissions

Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy (electricity, steam, heat, cooling), from a utility provider.


## Scope 3 GHG emissions

All other indirect emissions not included in scope 2 that occur in the value chain, both upstream and downstream. Ac- cording to the GHG protocol, scope 3 emissions are separated into 15 catego- ries, and include for example purchased goods and services, business travel and commuting or use of sold products.

value for all our stakeholders, for ABB, society and the environment. We are con- vinced that this is not only the right thing to do, but also in the interest of our long- term business success.


## Sustainability

Sustainability or sustainable develop- ment can be defined as "meeting the needs of the present without compro- mising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (Brundtland Report, 1987). Sustainability is commonly based on three dimensions: economic sustainability, environmental sustain- ability and social sustainability. At ABB, we strive to embed sustainability in ev- erything we do. Sustainability is at the center of our company purpose, strat- egy, operating model (the ABB Way) and objectives, and is a key part of the value that we create for our stakeholders.


## Sustainability strategy 2030

In 2020, ABB defined a clear strategy to contribute to a more sustainable soci- ety. The key pillars of our sustainability strategy 2030 are: enabling a low-carbon society, preserving resources, promot- ing social progress and creating a culture of integrity & transparency along the ex- tended value chain.


## V


## Value creation

The process that results in increases, decreases or transformations of "the capitals" and related outputs and out- comes caused by our business activi- ties in the short, medium and long term. We not only focus on maximizing share- holder value but work holistically to cre- ate financial and sustainability-linked

### Caution concerning forward-looking statements

The Integrated Report 2022 includes "forward-looking state- ments" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on current expectations, estimates and projections about the factors that may affect our future performance, including global economic conditions as well as the economic conditions of the regions and the industries that are major markets for ABB. The words "believe," "may," "will," "estimate," "continue," "target," "anticipate," "intend," "expect", "plan" and similar words and the express or implied discussion of strategy, plans or intentions are intended to identify for- ward-looking statements. These forward- looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among other things, the following: (i) business risks related to the global volatile economic environment; (ii) costs associated with compliance activities; (iii) difficulties encountered in operating in emerging markets; (iv) risks inherent in large, long term projects served by parts of our business; (v) the timely development of new products, technologies, and ser- vices that are useful for our customers; (vi) our ability to antic- ipate and react to technological change and evolving industry standards in the markets in which we operate; (vii) changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; (viii) changes in raw materials prices or limitations of supplies of raw materials; (ix) the weakening or unavailability of our intellectual property rights; (x) industry consolidation result- ing in more powerful competitors and fewer customers; (xi) effects of competition and changes in economic and market conditions in the product markets and geographic areas in which we operate; (xii) effects of, and changes in, laws, regulations, governmental policies, taxation, or accounting standards and practices and (xiii) other factors described in documents that we may furnish from time to time with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Reports on Form 20-F. Although we believe that the expecta- tions reflected in any such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that they will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements because of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking information, events and circumstances might not occur. Our actual results and performance could differ substantially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements.
