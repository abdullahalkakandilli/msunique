 Raiffeisen Switzerland


## Dear Readers,

Both from a social and an economic perspective, 2023 was a chal- lenging year. It was dominated by geopolitical tensions, weaker economic forecasts, the turnaround in interest rates and a momen- tous change in Switzerland as a financial centre. Raiffeisen managed to successfully remain on course in this challenging environment and to continue investing in its future. One thing is important to us: we work as a team to achieve success. Raiffeisen Switzerland and the 219 Raiffeisen banks share a basic principle within the Group: the cooperative business model. This makes Raiffeisen very stable, because we pursue a sustainable business policy within the Group, with a focus on stability and continuity.

"We pursue a sustainable business policy within the Group, with a focus on stability and continuity."

Thomas A. Müller hairman of the Board of Directors Raiffeisen Switzerland

We are shaping the future of the Group together. The Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland once again generated a very good result in 2023. We were able to increase the Group's income base to CHF 1.39 billion. More than 90% of the profit is retained in the form of reserves, further expanding our capital base. This strength- ens us and makes us a safe and financially strong bank. This is also confirmed by the international rating agencies: with its very good rating, Raiffeisen is one of the best-rated banks in the world.

<!-- PageNumber="4" -->

The successful financial year shows that we are on the right track and enables us, the Raiffeisen Group, to continue investing in phys- ical and digital advisory services for our clients. Technology is devel- oping rapidly, with the result that our clients' needs are changing. In line with its Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025, Raiffeisen is focusing on digital transformation and expanding its advisory services. Key projects include expansion of the pension and investment business, the launch of the new Raiffeisen app and digitalisation of the mort- gage process. We are also continuing to develop our range of ser- vices and advice across all channels. This enables our clients make their own choice as to how, when and where they conduct their banking transactions. Our advice remains personal and individual, no matter whether in the local branch office or via digital channels. After three years of implementing the strategy, we can see positive developments: Raiffeisen has started its journey and its investments in the future are beginning to pay off.

"Raiffeisen acts with an entrepre- neurial mindset, while also ensuring the Group's ability to connect and its future viability in the interests of its clients."

Heinz Huber Chairman of the Executive Board Raiffeisen Switzerland

Raiffeisen acts with an entrepreneurial mindset, while also ensuring the Group's ability to connect and its future viability in the interests of its clients. At the last Annual General Meeting of Raiffeisen Switzer- land, the Raiffeisen banks approved the most important revision of the Articles of Association in recent years. This modernisation was also developed in line with client requirements. The measures include simplifying membership for clients and providing Raiffeisen banks with the option of expanding their services.

The events in Switzerland as a banking centre posed challenges for the financial sector and policymakers in 2023, and continue to do so. We intend to tackle these challenges together, too. Raiffeisen joined the umbrella organisation of Swiss banks in summer 2023 and has also taken the position of Vice-Chairman of the Swiss Bank- ers Association. As the second-largest banking group, Raiffeisen aims to represent the interests of its Swiss private and corporate clients appropriately and play an active role in shaping the future of the Swiss financial centre.

Ultimately, we also want to share our success and play an active role. We have reported the social added value that Raiffeisen provides throughout Switzerland in the Raiffeisen "added value" barometer for the 2023 financial year: a total of CHF 413 million was invested in member benefits, employee training and continuing education, support for local projects and climate action. This local and national commitment is important to us, because the cooperative model and the proximity to our clients make the Raiffeisen Group unique.

Our business model has proven itself over more than 120 years. With our local roots and our focus on the domestic market, we will con- tinue to place emphasis on stability and continuity - and we are actively addressing the future. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board of Raiffeisen Switzerland, we would like to thank our 3.7 million clients most sincerely for the trust they place in Raiffeisen. Our more than 12,000 employees deserve a huge thank-you. Because "together" is what makes Raiffeisen different.

We hope you enjoy reading this report,

The Raiffeisen Group can look back on a very successful 2023 financial year. Raiffeisen recorded an excellent result in its operating business thanks to the successful work of the 219 Raiffeisen banks. By reinvesting most of the Group's profits, Raiffeisen has further reinforced the security and stability of the banking group.

Raiffeisen is on track with the implementation of the Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025. In the year under review, the Group made significant investments in digitalisation and advisory services, in an effort to align its services even more closely with client needs.

## Portrait

Raiffeisen's cooperative model guarantees that all banks within the Group and the cooperative members of each Raiffeisen bank can have a say in its running and participate in its success. Raiffeisen operates nationally, with regional roots, positioning it close to its clients. As a cooperative bank, Raiffeisen connects people and creates added value - for clients, members, employees, the environment and society.

<!-- PageNumber="14" -->


## Attractive cooperative bank

The first Raiffeisen bank in Switzerland was founded in Bichelsee (canton of Thurgau) in 1899 at the initiative of Pastor Johann Traber, and it commenced operations in 1900. The business model: a cooperative. All members should be able to use the services of their bank and are entitled to a say in how it is run. They also share responsibility for the cooperative's activities and how it fares.

The Raiffeisen Group now includes 219 Raiffeisen banks with a cooperative structure, local roots and more than 2 million members. Anyone who owns a share certificate will become a cooperative member of their Raiffeisen bank. Cooperative members or Raiffeisen members have voting rights and elect the Board of Directors of a Raiffeisen bank. They help decide on the further development of their Raiffeisen bank and benefit from its success. The share certificates earn an attractive interest rate. Members can also secure additional benefits.

Raiffeisen is the largest cooperative bank in Switzerland.

New members have been added as a result of the Raiffeisen Switzerland branches becoming inde- pendent.

### Commitment on local and national level

As a cooperative, Raiffeisen has long been investing in Switzerland, thus generating added value for its cooperative members and for society. Raiffeisen measures this with its "added value" barometer. In 2023, the Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland created added value of CHF 413 million. Raiffeisen members benefited from around CHF 360 million in the form of discounted banking products, interest on share certificates and member benefits.

The museum pass, which grants free entry to over 500 museums in Switzerland, was again the most popular member benefit in the year under review, with around 1 million admissions. In 2023, Raiffeisen members ordered over 200,000 discounted tickets for concerts, festivals and events, as well as over 100,000 discounted ski day tickets in over 20 ski resorts.

Raiffeisen granted CHF 31 million in the form of donations and sponsorship. It supports local asso- ciations, social institutions, sporting and cultural events as well as projects with a social dimension.

Raiffeisen also performs an important task as an employer with more than 12,000 employees. It sees meaningful activity, responsibility and initiative as the key elements of a socially responsible corporate policy. Raiffeisen invested around CHF 20 million in staff training and continuing education in the year under review.

In addition to measures to strengthen sustainability in each of the cooperative bank's business areas, Raiffeisen has made investments to mitigate climate change. Raiffeisen has invested a total of CHF 1 million in the Swiss Climate Foundation, the internal climate fund for energy efficiency measures and compensation of the remaining CO2 emissions. Raiffeisen banks are also major taxpayers in their respective municipalities.

413 CHF million is the amount of added value that Raiffeisen generated in the 2023 financial year.

## Our vision

Raiffeisen defines the framework for what it does through the vision "Raiffeisen - the innovative cooperative bank that connects people". The banking group inspires its clients with unique solutions. It is enhancing its proximity to clients and connecting people in Switzerland, in person and digitally. By putting its cooperative values into practice on a sustainable basis, Raiffeisen creates added value together with its cooperative members, its clients and its employees.

Connecting people means connecting them both online and in person.


## Our values

Raiffeisen acts in line with its cooperative values and its business policy is open and fair. The focus is on the cooperative members. They are involved in determining how their bank develops, resulting in exceptional proximity to clients. True to its origins, Raiffeisen wants to provide people with easy access to banking services. This will remain so in future.

Raiffeisen's business policy is open and fair.


## The cooperative values

Democracy Joint ownership and participation - where every member has a vote - is the democratic essence of the cooperative. Decisions are reached democratically.

Solidarity Mutual support and joint and several liability are, from a historical perspective, achieve- ments of the cooperative movement. Ultimately, solidarity is based on mutual trust.

Liberality We tackle tasks together, with self-motivation and self-reliance. Liberality emphasises the independence of the cooperative banks.


## The entrepreneurial values

Credibility We do what we say and keep our promises. We are credible in that our actions are reliable and consistent, and we reach transparent decisions.

B Entrepreneurship

We take responsibility for our actions at all levels. We act independently, responsibly and entrepreneurially.

Sustainability For us, sustainability means acting responsibly as a company and considering the ecologi- cal and social impact of our activities, in addition to the economic aspects. As a responsi- ble financial institution with a cooperative structure, we aim to continuously boost our sustainability performance.

Proximity Raiffeisen banks are rooted in the local population. They know and understand their clients, have a local/regional focus, and integrate into the market.

## Areas of business and expertise

In the private client business, almost half of the Swiss population relies on the expertise of Raiffeisen banks in the pensions and investments, and home and financing segments.

In the corporate clients business, Raiffeisen can provide products and total solutions for financing, payments, trading in interest rates, currencies and precious metals, transactions in the money and capital markets, and corporate finance services.

Within the Raiffeisen Group, the Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department is also responsible for the management, intra-Group transfer and procurement of liquidity. It ensures access to the financial markets and, as a centre of competence, it offers financial market products and services across the Group.


## Markets and clients

The Raiffeisen Group is focussed on the Swiss market. It is the second-largest player in the Swiss banking market and has the densest branch network in Switzerland. More than 90% of the Swiss population can reach one of the 784 Raiffeisen branches by car in 10 minutes. Raiffeisen's strong local roots are complemented by digital solutions, forming a hybrid business model. Clients can choose which services they wish to use and on which channels. Raiffeisen operates 1,549 ATMs for cash withdrawals in CHF and EUR (as at 31 December 2023). Raiffeisen e-banking is popular with clients. In the year under review, the number of e-banking agreements increased from 1.76 million to 1.90 million. The digital asset management app Raiffeisen Rio is currently used by around 12,000 pri- vate clients. Raiffeisen Switzerland's Client Service Centre handles around 2 million client enquiries per year, by phone or e-mail.

Raiffeisen has the densest branch network in Switzerland.

3.69 million clients have placed their trust in Raiffeisen.


## Private clients

The Raiffeisen Group is Switzerland's retail bank with the greatest client proximity. With over 3.69 mil- lion clients, the Group is the second-largest player in the Swiss banking market. This means that more than 40% of the Swiss population are clients of Raiffeisen. For more than a third of the clients, Raiffeisen is their main bank, calculated on the basis of current product use. When it comes to financing residential property, Raiffeisen's core business, the banking group is the market leader in Switzerland. Around one in every five mortgages in Switzerland originates from Raiffeisen. Raiffeisen is also well positioned in the pension and investment business due to its range of solutions.


## Corporate clients

Raiffeisen's corporate clients comprise around 221,000 companies (as at 31 December 2023) - mostly small and medium-sized companies. This is an area that Raiffeisen intends to develop, along with its market position in the Swiss SME market. The direct client activities arising from Raiffeisen Switzer- land's corporate clients, treasury and trading business are grouped together in the Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department. This means Raiffeisen can offer its corporate clients access to a broad range of products, advice and support from a single source, resulting in short lines of decision-making.

## Structure and governance

Each Raiffeisen bank is a legally and organisationally independent cooperative with directly elected banking bodies. The members of the cooperative form part of the responsible body of each bank.

Raiffeisen Switzerland takes care of the strategic management of the entire Raiffeisen Group and creates the framework conditions for the business activities of the Raiffeisen banks. Raiffeisen Switzer- land is responsible for risk management, liquidity and capital ratios, and refinancing for the entire Group. Raiffeisen Switzerland also takes on treasury, trading and transaction activities in the role of a central bank.

The owners' committees - the Owners' Meeting, Raiffeisen Bank Council, Expert Committee Coor- dination and the expert committees represent an important component of the governance revised in 2019. The owner strategy brings together the interests, positions and expectations of the Raiffeisen banks as owners in relation to Raiffeisen Switzerland.

For more details, see the chapter "Corporate governance", 2] pages 106-135.

## Environment and trends

As a retail bank, the Raiffeisen Group oper- ates in a dynamic environment. Economic, social and sector-specific trends have an impact on Raiffeisen's activities over the medium to long term. The interest rate turn- around and the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS dominated the Swiss financial market in 2023.

## Dynamic economic and market environment

The year 2023 saw many changes in the economic and market environment. The economic slowdown and the central banks' monetary policy had a particular impact on the development of the market.


## A challenging economic environment

The energy cost situation eased in 2023 and affected the global economy much less severely than expected. Economic momentum has nevertheless declined significantly, due to higher interest rates and the persistently high cost of living. Industry in particular had a tough time, as demand for goods slowed significantly following the pandemic-related boom. The supply bottlenecks for many prelim- inary products have largely eased due to the downturn in global demand. However, the order backlog that built up during the bottleneck period has largely disappeared, including at Swiss industrial companies. The service sector held up much better in 2023. The negative impact of high inflation and interest rate hikes was nevertheless also increasingly felt in this sector of the economy. The sit- uation on the Swiss labour market remained stable, as companies were still reluctant to cut jobs for the time being, due to staff shortages.

Meanwhile, persistent inflation declined during the year under review. Procurement costs have fallen noticeably, with the result that retail prices have stopped rising as sharply. At the turn of 2024, higher rents and electricity prices were among the costs causing inflation to rise again. Apart from this, however, the general price level remained unchanged thanks to the strong CHF and moderate wage growth, making it much more relaxed than in neighbouring countries. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) raised the key interest rate to 1.75% by June 2023, but did not raise it any further throughout the rest of the year.


## Despite interest rate turnaround, no slump in prices on residential housing market

Following the SNB interest rate turnaround, money market mortgages have also become noticeably more expensive, following on from long-term fixed-rate mortgages. Although demand for private residential property fell in 2023, it remained robust overall. As the supply of residential property is becoming increasingly scarce in view of continuing demand, there are no signs of a major correction in house prices. On the Swiss rental housing market, the shortage of residential space continued to become more acute: the vacancy rate fell again in the year under review. There were nevertheless still no signs of significantly greater residential construction in the future. There are no signs of any rapid easing in this respect, even though interest rates are expected to fall in 2024.

As intended, Raiffeisen's mortgage business has grown at market level in recent years. The principle of "prioritising security over profitability and growth" applies here. The Raiffeisen banks pursue a prudent lending policy. The affordability calculation remains based on an imputed interest rate of 5%. This ensures that mortgage borrowers can afford the financing costs even if interest rates rise.


### Market environment remains challenging

In the period under review, Switzerland's largest bank, UBS, acquired Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-largest bank. Switzerland as a banking centre has changed as a result. The new mega-bank continues to hold a leading position in business with corporate clients and institutional investors such as insurance companies and pension funds, particularly among medium-sized and larger companies. The new situation in Switzerland as a banking centre could also have an impact on competition. Foreign banks are likely to enter the market. As a competent banking partner for Swiss companies, the Raiffeisen Group continues to invest in the needs-orientated servicing of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), and in business with medium-sized and large companies. The banking group continues to prioritise its own security and stability over rapid volume growth in this segment.

Due to its proximity to clients, Raiffeisen is well positioned in an intensively competitive environment and has a deep understanding of its clients' needs. The Group has defined its priorities for the coming years in its Raiffeisen 2025 strategy. The new competitive situation does not change this.

Despite the interest rate turnaround, demand for residential property in Switzerland remains high.

## Trends in retail banking

Banking is changing. The needs of clients have changed fundamentally over time - mainly driven by digitalisation, but also the demand for greater sustainability. Competition is increasing. Neobanks are raising client expectations with their digital products. Raiffeisen has responded to these trends with its Raiffeisen 2025 strategy.

Raiffeisen is responding to current trends with its Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025

Higher interest rates are having an increasing impact on the global economy.

For more details, see the chapter "Strategy", 2 pages 24-28.


## Continuing trend in terms of sustainability

Society increasingly expects visible and credible corporate responsibility initiatives from companies. Both established banks and new market players have responded to this change. In retail banking, the focus is primarily on sustainable investment products, sustainable home ownership advice, and measuring CO2 and compensating for it. In the lending and issuing business, too, financial service providers are increasingly aligning themselves with sustainability criteria. Sustainability is a central element of the Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025.

For more details, see the chapter "Sustainability", 2] pages 51-78.

New digital approaches to sales and advice are becoming established

New digital approaches to sales and advice are increasingly becoming established in the Swiss banking market. Both video-based advisory sessions and the use of chat and message channels are becoming increasingly popular among clients. Client interactions that are not dependent on location or time will complement existing channels and formats in the retail and corporate clients business. This hybrid advisory model is being expanded at Raiffeisen as part of the Group strategy. Raiffeisen Switzerland also manages the operation and ongoing development of its digital channels. These include the raiffeisen.ch website, e-banking, the Client Service Centre and other specialised applications such as the MemberPlus portal, the TWINT chatbot and the TWINT app.

The hybrid advisory model is gaining in importance.

Competition for the client interface remains fierce

The offering from fintechs and neobanks continues to grow and is gaining in maturity. A major advantage of neobanks is their consistent focus on client needs and the high level of user-friendliness of their digital products, which are often digital only. It is therefore unsurprising that neobanks have now established themselves as providers. Although their product ranges are not yet comprehensive, they are being constantly expanded. Raiffeisen has recognised these trends and, as part of its Group strategy, is further expanding digital access to its services, while also investing in the user-friendliness of its digital channels.

Cooperation between financial service providers and real estate specialists should increase both parties' access to potential new clients for housing and mortgages. The momentum in this network of real estate and financing experts has again recently slowed somewhat. Raiffeisen is focusing on its own channels for housing and mortgages and is investing in strengthening the digital presence of raiffeisen.ch and in the expertise of its advisors.

Switzerland as a banking centre has changed in the year under review.

## Artificial intelligence is becoming an everyday digital assistant

The use of new technologies in banking has opened up new opportunities in advisory services, set- tlement and other service offerings. One technology that is poised to become mainstream is (gener- ative) artificial intelligence, recently fuelled by the success of ChatGPT. Advancements in this area and the number of further practical use cases are likely to increase in the coming months and become more relevant to banking. Raiffeisen is closely following the development of the technology in the direction of an everyday digital assistant. Even at this stage, Raiffeisen is testing various applications to boost internal efficiency, for example, through the use of ChatGPT. It is also investing in the integration of new forms of interaction for conversational banking. This involves dialogue-based communication with clients, for example, by means of live chat, chatbots or voicebots. Raiffeisen is also integrating artificial intelligence applications into new products and solutions, for example, for digital client onboarding and in the mortgage business. In doing so, Raiffeisen places great emphasis on data protection and data security.


## Focus on IT infrastructure and automation

As digitalisation becomes more advanced, banks are coming under more pressure to automate internal processes and become even more client-centric. Raiffeisen is continuously optimising and digitalising its core processes. Innovative solutions are also used for this purpose, such as process mining for data-based analysis of processes, or robot-based process automation (RPA). Raiffeisen is also continuing to invest in the optimisation of its IT infrastructure, cyber defences and new cloud applications, and in enhancing its employees' skills.


### Implementation of initial use cases for open finance

Open banking describes the opening and provision of client data to third-party providers. Future market developments will be shaped by regulatory requirements on the one hand and new market standards on the other. In this context, Raiffeisen is in close dialogue with interest groups (Swiss Bankers Association, Swiss Fintech Innovations). Over the next year, the first Swiss banks will pilot an initial multibanking service for natural persons. The service will focus on the exchange of account and payment information ("read only"). This will enable accounts from several banks to be managed through a single digital application. As part of its Group strategy, Raiffeisen is currently focusing on developing new systems and environments, such as the Raiffeisen app. This allows Raiffeisen to create the technical groundwork for providing marketable open finance services where required. Raiffeisen already operates the SME eServices multibanking solution in the corporate clients business, which launched in autumn 2019.


## Shortage of skilled workers and digitalisation are shaping new forms of collaboration

The Swiss labour market is in robust shape. The unemployment rate in Switzerland is at a very low level; the available labour pool is correspondingly small at present. This exacerbates the shortage of skilled workers that has existed in Switzerland for years. It affects a range of sectors such as healthcare, hospitality, and information and communication technology. IT specialists in particular are very impor- tant for implementing banks' extensive digitalisation projects. The takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS has increased the talent pool in the market over the short to medium term, with the result that some specialised roles at Raiffeisen have been filled with talent more quickly.

One of the areas in which Raiffeisen integrates artificial intelligence applications is digital client onboarding.

Regulatory disclosure Key figures

Digitalisation and social change are also transforming the world of work. Employers are faced with two developments: they must meet the challenges posed by digitalisation as well as the individual demands of employees for a digital and flexible working environment. This change affects the cor- porate culture, the perception of management and the handling of skills that are needed for the new world of work. Raiffeisen Switzerland has invested in the digital world of work and its corporate culture. Raiffeisen Switzerland also enables its employees to work flexibly under the Raiffeisen Flex- Work programme. This means that Raiffeisen Switzerland staff can spend up to 80% of their time working from a place of their choice, in consultation with their line manager and if compatible with the activity.

For more details, see the chapter "Employees", 2] pages 79-90.

Regulations continue to set the tone for banks

Increasing regulatory requirements need additional expertise and resources. Liquidity, compliance and capital adequacy requirements for banks are rising steadily. The security of energy supply continues to be an increasingly important issue. This is due to the security of supply against the backdrop of power shortages during the winter, and increasing cyber risks. Raiffeisen Switzerland is in close contact with the Raiffeisen banks in this regard and supports them in mitigating risks.

Digitalisation is creating a new, changed world of work.

Raiffeisen is currently focusing on the development of new systems, such as the Raiffeisen app.

## Strategy

The goal of the Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025 is to focus consistently on clients and have more time to provide advice. Raiffeisen is expanding access to its digital services, strengthening its pension and investment business, and boosting efficiency by implementing a simple and semi- automated mortgage process. Raiffeisen is investing in advisory services for the interaction between the digital world and the local Raiffeisen banks.

<!-- PageNumber="24" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->


## Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025

The Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025 sets out the strategic direction for the period 2021-2025. It was developed in 2020 in an extensive and participative process, and lays out the Raiffeisen Group's future direction. It also shows how Raiffeisen intends to position itself in the Swiss banking market, so that it can continue to operate as a successful cooperative bank with a local presence.


## What guides our activities

Raiffeisen is guided by its cooperative values in its dealings with cooperative members, clients, staff and society. Both in its day-to-day operations and when implementing the strategy, Raiffeisen acts according to the following principles:

\- Raiffeisen strives for a management culture focused on profit and efficiency, but not profit maximisation.

\- Raiffeisen is a bank that connects people. It appeals to all stakeholders, connects people based on its values and creates added value.

\- Raiffeisen generally positions itself as a smart follower in the change process, which ensures a correspondingly significant reduction in business risk.

\- Raiffeisen's strength lie in its structure as a team and Group. The cooperative model allows Raiffeisen to stand out from its competitors as an innovative community of values and added value.

\- Raiffeisen is evolving from a provider of products to a provider of solutions, while also driving its cost efficiency through scale, quality, standardisation and digital transformation.

\- One thing is always true for the banking group: security, stability, sustainability and high-quality growth come first.


## Strategic goals

Raiffeisen pursues a hybrid approach, utilising both in-person and digital services to meet client needs., wherever they arise. As the retail bank with the highest level of client satisfaction, Raiffeisen is striving to further develop its proximity to clients. At Raiffeisen, clients do not have to choose between digital banking services and personal advice at the branch. Clients can choose which channel they prefer to use at that particular time. Raiffeisen ensures that the transition between the digital world and personal contact with the advisor is straightforward. As a result, Raiffeisen is investing in expanding its digital and physical client proximity by focussing on four key strategic projects:

\- strengthening the pension and investment business through client-orientated solutions and comprehensive advice;

\- expanding digital client access through a new Raiffeisen app, which brings together Raiffeisen's digital services in one place;

\- more efficiency and time for clients by digitalising and automating the mortgage process as Raiffeisen's core business, from the enquiry to the decision on granting the mortgage;

\- further strengthening of client advisory, as interaction between local Raiffeisen banks and the digital world.

Raiffeisen continues to develop its proximity to clients: in person at local Raiffeisen banks and through its digital service channels.

The cooperative model and the associated values remain a key distinctive feature for the Raiffeisen Group.

## Strategic progress

The Raiffeisen 2025 strategy is being implemented in three waves. The first wave (2021-2022) established the basis for a successful transformation by expanding the product range (particularly pensions and investments), simplifying processes and piloting initial developments. In the second wave (2023-2024), initiatives will be advanced that will allow Raiffeisen to gain more quality time for clients. The new Raiffeisen app and the semi-automated mortgage process in particular will be the priority in the second wave. The third wave (2025) will focus on setting the bank apart by delivering hybrid advice, in particular investment advice, with some final work taking place in 2026.


### Pension and investment business further expanded

Raiffeisen expanded its range of pension and investment products in 2022. This included enhancing the functionality of the digital pension solution, launching index-tracking investment funds, extending the range of advisory mandates and aligning the existing asset management and advisory mandates fully with sustainability. Raiffeisen is now an asset management bank - for everyone. In the year under review, the proportion of clients investing their money with Raiffeisen increased further. Since the beginning of the strategy period, the number of investment securities accounts has increased by 35.2%. Raiffeisen also passed the mark of half a million securities accounts in 2023. The increase in net new money in the securities business of CHF 2.9 billion compared to the previous year in a challenging market environment confirms the trust that clients place in Raiffeisen when it comes to pensions and investments. Raiffeisen's asset management mandates are particularly popular. In 2023, the number of asset management mandates increased by 25.3%. They are available from a minimum investment of CHF 50,000. With this low entry threshold, Raiffeisen hopes to enable a broader client base to delegate management of their assets to a professional partner.

\+35.2%

Since the beginning of the strategy period at the start of 2021, the number of investment securities accounts has increased by one third.


### Raiffeisen app launched for first client groups

Major importance is attached to expansion of digital channels in the Raiffeisen 2025 strategy. Raiffeisen made the new Raiffeisen app available to the first client groups in the year under review. The app enables users to become a Raiffeisen client within a few minutes. This speed is partly due to an identification process that allows clients to scan their passport or ID card, or read the data using NFC technology. There is no need to sign physical agreements, so banking is simplified. The right banking package and the app's most important functions are available to users immediately after digital onboarding. The app has been tested thoroughly with the first client groups since mid- 2023. The app currently includes the most frequently used banking functions such as payments, asset statements and card management. In the course of user tests and on the basis of user feedback, the app functionality and, in a later step, the desktop version of the app will be gradually expanded in line with client requirements.

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->


#### Advisory service strengthened

Raiffeisen is focusing on a comprehensive approach to advice and is investing in advisory services and tools capable of handling future demands. The goal is to provide clients with comprehensive advice throughout the various events and stages of their lives. Raiffeisen continued to professional- ise its advisory processes in the year under review, while also investing in support for its advisors. For example, new tools and aids such as those for the mortgage process were made available to advisors.

Measures to implement prudent home ownership advice were also continued in the year under review. Besides advice on mortgages, clients are advised on finding a property or renovating their property. The aim is to provide clients with competent and comprehensive advice throughout the entire life-cycle, from search to sale. Services were further developed in the year under review. For example, a modernisation check was introduced, providing clients with an illustration of their prop- erty's energy efficiency. Starting from 2024, Raiffeisen will be subject to the regulatory requirement of reporting the long-term value retention and thus also the energy efficiency and foreseeable ren- ovation requirements of the property to be financed during every consultation on home ownership. To further enhance the client experience in the residential property segment, the brand identity of Raiffeisen Immo AG has been refined. Since 1 January 2024, the subsidiary of Raiffeisen Switzerland has been offering its agency services under the new brand Raiffeisen Immomakler.


## Goal achievement and outlook

Raiffeisen is on track with its strategy of substantially expanding its client focus. The priorities set in the Group strategy are also able to withstand dynamic changes in the market. This is also reflected in the strategic metrics. Due to the increases in operating income, the cost/income ratio remained at a very good level and, at 51.9%, has improved in comparison to the previous year. This underlines, among other things, the ongoing efficiency gains that have been achieved despite significant invest- ments in the strategy. The neutral business also increased by 4.1% to CHF 880.0 million in the year under review. Due to the equally strong interest operations and the challenging situation on equity markets, however, the proportion of neutral business in operating income was lower compared to the previous year. Raiffeisen succeeded in further strengthening its pension and investment business.

The cooperative continues to enjoy great popularity. Raiffeisen added around 56,000 new cooperative members in 2023. Around one in four adults in Switzerland is now a member of a Raiffeisen bank. In January 2023, the last two branches of Raiffeisen Switzerland, Basel and Zurich, were also converted into independent cooperatives. The Bern, Thalwil, St. Gallen and Winterthur branches had previously been made independent. By making the branches independent, Raiffeisen is consistently implementing the fundamental cooperative principle across all Raiffeisen banks.

The number of clients also increased significantly by around 55,000 in the year under review. The Group now has 3.69 million clients. The percentage of clients who use Raiffeisen as their main bank has also increased to a high level, demonstrating the trust placed in Raiffeisen.

Having improved its position in the Universum employer ranking by 12 places to 23rd in the previous year, Raiffeisen took 36th place across all sectors in 2023. The companies named as ideal employers in the current survey achieved percentages that are close to each other. Raiffeisen believes it is on course to achieve its ambitious goal of ranking among the top 20 employers by 2025. This is further confirmed by the fact that, as in the previous year, Raiffeisen received the "Top Company 2024" award from the Kununu employer rating platform.

Raiffeisen invests in the training and continuing education of its advisors so that they can provide competent advice and support for their clients.

Raiffeisen is on track with its strategy of substantially expanding its client focus.

The new Raiffeisen app enables users to become a client within a few minutes.


### Semi-automated process for new mortgages for private residential property

The mortgage business is Raiffeisen's core business. Accordingly, the mortgage process plays a sig- nificant role in the ongoing implementation of the strategy. The aim is to boost efficiency and con- sequently gain more time for clients through standardisation and automation. Since the end of the year under review, the new process has been available to Raiffeisen banks for standard cases of new client business, where it involves owner-occupied residential property for private clients. Using the new mortgage process, it is possible to prepare and post-process the majority of loan enquiries from private clients in a standardised procedure, for example, by automatically recognising the relevant loan documents using artificial intelligence. Financing proposals can then be generated automatically. In addition, advisors have access to a digital tool to show their clients different options for financing. With this new process, clients receive an answer to their loan application more quickly. The banks gain time that they can invest in providing advice. Once the next key step has been completed, the new process will also be used for existing business (renewals and increases).

By using the new workflow from applica- tion to the granting of the mortgage, Raiffeisen is gaining time that it can use to provide personal advice to its clients.

Result

The year has been a successful one for the Raiffeisen Group. It slightly expanded its strong market position in the client business and increased its operating income. Raiffeisen generated a Group profit of CHF 1.39 billion. Of this amount, 92.4% was allocated to reserves, which further strengthens the banking group's capital base.

1 The calculation of return on equity (ROE) is based on profit including minority interests and before tax, and changes in reserves for general banking risks.

2 According to the systemic importance regime.

3 The liquidity-coverage-ratio (LCR) measures whether a bank has sufficient liquid funds to cover its liquidity needs from its own funds over a 30-day period in the event of an emergency. The LCR puts the available liquid funds in relation to the expected net outflow.

4 The net-stable-funding-ratio (NSFR) serves to ensure sustainable and stable funding of a bank's lending and off-balance-sheet activities. In particular, it limits the risk of a bank financing its lending activities with deposits that are deemed too unstable and short-term.

5 The client assets shown include custody account assets plus liabilities arising from client deposits and cash bonds. "Liabilities arising from client deposits" includes client deposits that are not similar to an investment. The following are not included: fiduciary deposits, custody-only relation- ships (third-party banks and institutional clients where Raiffeisen acts solely as custodian) and assets of institutional investors where the business activity consists of liquidity and repo investments. Reclassifications between assets under management and unreported assets (such as custody-only) are shown as a change in net new money.

## Successful financial year for the Raiffeisen Group

The financial year has been a successful one for the Raiffeisen Group. The high number of new clients and the encouraging growth in business volume reflect the continuing high level of client trust. Raiffeisen was thus able to expand its strong market position in the mortgage business and in customer deposits. Income from the client business also increased. Due to the gradual normalisation of interest rates and the positive growth in loans to clients, the performance of the net interest income was particularly good. Income from the neutral business once again exceeded the previous year's high result. With Group profit of CHF 1.39 billion, the Raiffeisen Group generated an outstanding result. CHF 1.28 billion of this amount after interest on cooperative capital will be allocated directly to reserves and further strengthen the already strong capital base. Thanks to the ongoing retention of earnings, Raiffeisen is a safe and stable bank.


### Growth in the core business

The business volume also grew in 2023. Mortgage loans performed very well and increased by CHF 7.3 billion (+3.6%) to a total of CHF 211.0 billion. This trend indicates that the Raiffeisen Group has performed well in a highly competitive environment and slightly expanded its strong market position. Market share increased slightly from 17.6% in the previous year to 17.8%. This is in line with Raiffeisen's aim to grow at roughly the same rate as the market. Due to the interest rate situation, demand for money market-based products was especially high in the first half of the year. The proportion of "SARON Flex" mortgages in the portfolio increased from 18.6% in the previous year to 22.1%. Amounts due from clients increased by CHF 680.3 million (+6.2%) to CHF 11.6 billion. As a result, total loans to clients increased by CHF 8.0 billion (+3.7%), of which around CHF 2.9 billion came from the corporate clients business. As there have been no changes to the cautious risk policy, the quality of the credit portfolio remains high. Almost 90% of the credit portfolio is covered by mortgages. Risks are managed systematically and closely monitored. The need for value adjustments is accordingly low. Value adjustments for impaired receivables stood at CHF 289.0 million, or 0.130% of loans to clients. At 0.006% of loans to clients, the percentage of effective losses from lending activities is at an extremely low level.

\+3.6% Qualitative growth in the core business continued.

Raiffeisen further expanded its strong market position in its core business.

Raiffeisen Group Annual Report 2023

On the liabilities side, customer deposits grew more moderately, but were still well above the market level. The increase in liabilities arising from customer deposits amounts to CHF 3.1 billion (+1.5%). This represents a portfolio of CHF 207.8 billion as at the end of 2023. Raiffeisen increased its market share from 14.5% at the end of the previous year to 15.1%. Due to the stronger growth in loans, the refinancing level from client business fell to 93.4% (end of previous year: 95.4%). This means that more than 90% of loans to clients are still refinanced at a stable level with customer deposits. In addition to the increase in volume, the growth in the number of clients also reflects the high level of trust in the Raiffeisen Group. Around 55,000 new clients were welcomed in 2023. The number of members has also increased. The number of cooperative members increased by around 56,000 to 2.06 million. A major factor in this was the conversion of the last two branches of Raiffeisen Swit- zerland into independent cooperative banks. Clients of the new Raiffeisen banks in Zurich and Basel were able to subscribe to cooperative shares, thus becoming co-owners of their Raiffeisen bank.

The inflows into the pension and investment business were again favourable. The securities account volume rose by CHF 4.5 billion, from CHF 41.1 billion at the end of the previous year to CHF 45.6 billion (+11.0%). New money amounting to CHF 2.9 billion was paid into pension and investment securities accounts. Developments on the financial markets also had a positive effect. Raiffeisen opened around 25,000 new securities accounts, a large proportion of which were pension securities accounts (+9.4%) and asset management mandates (+25.3%). Due to the increase in customer deposits and securities account volumes, assets under management rose by CHF 7.4 billion (+3.1%) to a total of CHF 249.7 billion.

Driven by growth in the core business, the Group's total assets went up by CHF 16.5 billion (+5.9%) to CHF 297.1 billion. Besides the growth in balance sheet items resulting from the core business, there were significant changes arising from active balance sheet and liquidity management. This relates to amounts due from banks, which increased by CHF 3.9 billion to CHF 6.1 billion (+178.0%); and to amounts due to banks, which increased by CHF 2.6 billion to a total of CHF 16.6 billion (+18.8%). The item "Liabilities from securities financing transactions" increased from CHF 35 million to CHF 8.9 billion. These are repo transactions in which money is borrowed against securities collateral. Management is opportunistic, depending on the needs of liquidity management and on market conditions. For this reason, this item may be subject to greater fluctuations depending on the reporting date. Liquid assets also increased within the scope of liquidity management. Securities holdings in the "Financial investments" item, mainly investment-grade bonds, are managed in accordance with liquidity requirements and internal liquidity targets. The book value decreased by CHF 4.3 billion to CHF 10.9 billion (-28.4%). This was mainly due to expired debt securities issued by the SNB (SNB bills).

Bond issues and central mortgage institution loans increased by CHF 1.1 billion (+3.5%) to CHF 33.1 billion. This is chiefly due to an increase in central mortgage institution loans. Raiffeisen Switzerland also issued another bail-in bond of EUR 500 million last year. The underlying instruments of the structured products issued by Raiffeisen Switzerland recognised in the "Bond issues and central mortgage institution loans" item have decreased. Despite this, Raiffeisen was able to maintain sales at the previous year's level, even though the market for structured products declined slightly in 2023. The book value of the structured products issued by the Raiffeisen Group totalled CHF 2.4 billion as at 31 December 2023.

#### Increase in income from operating activities

The Group's income situation has once again performed very well. This was mainly due to strong interest operations, which benefited from the turnaround in interest rates and growth in loans to clients. The gross interest income climbed CHF 529.9 million (+20.6%) to CHF 3.1 billion. Net value adjustments for default risks and losses from interest operations amounting to CHF 26.7 million were recognised in the 2023 financial year, representing a CHF 7.1 million increase compared to the same period of the previous year (previous year: CHF 19.6 million). This item also includes value adjustments for expected credit losses. The increase, however, is due to a rise in individual value adjustments. In relation to interest income, default risk-related value adjustments and losses from lending activities remain low. As a result, net income from interest operations went up by CHF 522.7 million to CHF 3.1 billion (+20.5%). The interest margin has also recovered due to the turnaround in interest rates. At 1.08%, it is back above 1% for the first time since 2018.

The turnaround in interest rates and growth in loans to clients are reflected in the main pillar of income.

Income from the neutral business once again exceeded the previous year's outstanding result. Income from commission business and services transactions rose to CHF 624.4 million. This represents an increase of CHF 33.0 million (+5.6%). First, income from the securities and investment business performed well. Second, commission income from other services increased, mainly due to the change in the charging model for issuing credit cards. This was then also reflected in higher commission expenses.

Net trading income and the fair value option increased slightly from a high level, rising by CHF 1.3 million (+0.5%) to CHF 255.6 million. In the foreign exchange business, the Raiffeisen Group was able to build on the previous year's successful result. The high level of broadly-based utilisation across all Raiffeisen channels for cross-border payment transactions is particularly positive. The pro- portion of neutral business in operating income was 21.6% at the end of the year under review.

Other income from ordinary activities fell CHF 16.9 million (-12.6%) from the previous year to CHF 116.7 million. This is due to exceptional items in the previous year. High write-ups were recognised for the participation in Leonteq AG and Viseca Payment Services AG in the past year, as part of the equity valuation. For this reason, income from participations was significantly lower than in the previous year. In contrast, sales of financial investments generated higher income.

Raiffeisen Group Annual Report 2023


## Profitability improved once again

As expected, Raiffeisen posted an increase on the expenses side. Personnel expenses climbed CHF 96.7 million (+6.8%) to CHF 1.5 billion in the year under review. The Group's headcount increased by 404 full-time positions. Most of this expansion was aimed at supporting clients at local Raiffeisen banks. Operating expenditure increased by CHF 44.0 million (+8.1%) to CHF 587.0 million. A significant proportion of additional expenditure was for client and member events, and higher sponsorship contributions were made. The Raiffeisen Group also continued to invest in implementing the Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025.

The higher general and administrative expenses are due in part to the large number of member and client events that were held.

Value adjustments on participations and depreciation and amortisation of tangible fixed assets and intangible assets increased by CHF 57.9 million compared to the previous year (+30.7%) to CHF 246.7 million in the year under review. This is partly due to higher depreciation on tangible fixed assets, in particular real estate. It is also attributable to a value adjustment for the participation in Leonteq AG, which became necessary as part of the periodical review of recoverability. Other minor valuation adjustments were made to minority participations. The item "Changes in provisions and other value adjustments, and losses" was significantly lower at CHF 1.1 million, representing a decline of CHF 12.9 million (-91.9%).


### High operating result and Group profit

Due to the increases in operating income, the operating result is significantly higher than the previous year's figure. The operating result increased by CHF 354.5 million (+26.2%) to CHF 1.7 billion. The lower extraordinary expenses are due to losses from the disposal of tangible fixed assets and the deconsolidation of a participation in the prior-year period. The changes in extraordinary income are also attributable to items in the previous year, in which gains from the sale of participations were recognised. Tax expenses increased by CHF 72.3 million (+36.9%) to CHF 268.5 million. The financial statements of the Raiffeisen Group include provisions for deferred taxes to correctly present the tax effect of the measurement differences between the Group's true-and-fair-view financial statements and the single-entity financial statements of the consolidated companies from the accounting per- spective. The actual tax expenses were CHF 224.8 million in the year under review.

As a result of the strong increase in operating income, the cost/income ratio continue to improve, from 55.9% at the end of the previous year to 51.9% despite the rise in costs. This excellent figure reflects the Raiffeisen Group's high profitability.

The strong operating performance in the first half of 2023 made it possible to strengthen the reserves for general banking risks by CHF 50 million. With profits of CHF 1.39 billion and an increase of CHF 208.8 million (+17.7%), the previous year's good result was once again significantly exceeded. The Raiffeisen Group thus closed the financial year with excellent results.


#### Retention of earnings as the basis for security and stability

As a cooperative bank, Raiffeisen differs from stock corporations in that it passes on benefits in the form of services, while the majority of profits remain in the business in the form of reserves. As Raiffeisen is classified as systemically important, it has to meet higher capital requirements for a going concern and higher requirements for loss-absorbing capital in the event of a crisis (gone concern). Raiffeisen easily meets the requirements due to its high level of core capital. The high degree of earnings retention in the cooperative model enables the Group to strengthen its core capital on an ongoing basis. CHF 1.28 billion of this amount after interest on cooperative capital will be allocated to retained earnings reserves for 2023, representing 92.4% of profit.

The Group also received new cooperative capital as a result of the conversion of the last two branches of Raiffeisen Switzerland into independent cooperative banks. The most important element in capi- talising the new Raiffeisen banks in Zurich and Basel was the subscription of cooperative share cer- tificates by clients. The other Raiffeisen banks also contributed to the increase in cooperative capital by CHF 344.1 million (+11.2%) to CHF 3.4 billion.

Raiffeisen issued capital instruments once again in 2023. The Group succeeded in placing a further bail-in bond amounting to EUR 500 million and reissuing an AT1 bond amounting to CHF 100 million, despite a difficult market environment. Transitional provisions apply until 2026 for building up the gone-concern funds required by regulation. As Raiffeisen has sufficient surplus going-concern capital and because of the bail-in instruments issued, it already meets in full the requirements in the event of a crisis and for emergency planning, i.e. without transitional provisions being applied.

<!-- PageNumber="38" -->

The unweighted TLAC leverage ratio improved to 8.3% (as at 31 December 2022: 8.2%) and the risk-weighted TLAC ratio increased to 25.8% (as at 31 December 2022: 24.9%). This corresponds to capital and loss-absorbing capital amounting to CHF 25.0 billion at the end of 2023, a solid and strong capital base.

Even at this stage, Raiffeisen easily meets the regulatory requirements specified for 2026.

The excellent capitalisation and the robust quality of loans led the rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) to increase its rating for Raiffeisen in the spring of 2023, raising the long-term issuer credit rating from the previous A+ to the current AA-, and the short-term issuer credit rating from A-1 to A-1+.

Very good rating from the rating agency Standard & Poor's.

92.4%

Raiffeisen Group Annual Report 2023


## Outlook 2024

The slowdown in the global economy, together with the strong Swiss franc, is posing growing challenges for Swiss exporters. The business outlook for industry in particular remains gloomy as a consequence. In contrast, the service sector is doing better, thanks to the resilient labour market and continuing strong immigration, even though private consumption is losing some steam as incomes are stagnating in real terms. With the economy lacking momentum, Raiffeisen expects below-average growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.8% for 2024. As long as the upward pressure on the Swiss franc does not get out of control, the SNB will probably cut interest rates once or twice, but not until the second half of the year.

The Swiss real estate market has coped with the interest rate turnaround better than expected. Although the lower demand has led to a drop in transaction volume within the residential property market and slightly falling prices in certain regions, the risk of a price correction is very low. Meanwhile, there is still considerable scarcity on the rental property market and rents are continuing to rise. As interest rates have peaked and mortgage rates have already eased noticeably, however, the real estate situation has brightened overall and valuation corrections for investment properties are likely to be moderate.

On the capital markets, Raiffeisen expects a challenging year in 2024. In particular, the uncertainty surrounding central banks' monetary policy could lead to relatively large fluctuations. For this reason, we recommend active investment tactics to take advantage of opportunities. The defensive Swiss equity market is likely to perform well in this scenario. Swiss real estate funds also offer growth potential following their weak performance over the past two years. Given the economic and geo- political uncertainties, gold remains an attractive addition to investments.

Development of the Raiffeisen Group's business

After a successful year in 2023, Raiffeisen can look to the coming year with confidence. Implemen- tation of the Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025 is on course. The aim is to further increase neutral income, especially in the securities and investment business. On the cost side, Raiffeisen expects expenses to rise as a result of growth and expansion in the areas of digitalisation, customer experience and client advisory. Based on current interest rate forecasts and a declining interest margin, Raiffeisen expects solid business performance in 2024, with a result that may not quite reach the previous year's level.

Raiffeisen is well posi- tioned and expects a solid result for 2024.

Client solutions

Raiffeisen provides its clients with comprehensive support on equal terms: for pension solutions, investment opportu- nities, financing a home owner's renova- tion or succession planning within the firm, for example. Nearly half of the Swiss population and around one-third of Swiss companies now trust in the solutions and skills of the Raiffeisen banks.

## Enhancing products with a focus on the digital customer experience

As part of the Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025, Raiffeisen is investing substantial sums in further expanding its digital channels. It is striving to create a seamless interaction between digital channels and personal points of contact. Clients should be able to choose how they want to interact with Raiffeisen. It aims to develop a Raiffeisen app and a web portal that will bundle all its digital services into one self-service platform. An initial version of the new Raiffeisen app has been available since September 2023, offered to new clients who wish to open a banking relationship at a Raiffeisen bank.


## Payments: products and solutions

Accounts and cards form the basis for payment processing. Raiffeisen also offers a range of channels and solutions to enable its clients to make payments efficiently at home and abroad. These include e-banking, TWINT, and various credit and debit cards.


## E-banking - the most frequently used interaction channel

E-banking is the most frequently used interaction channel between Raiffeisen clients and their Raiffeisen bank. In total, more than 1.90 million users (previous year: 1.76 million) logged into e-banking over 164 million times (previous year: 141 million times) in 2023. Around 63% of logins were made through the mobile banking app (previous year: 55%). On average, users logged into e-banking seven times a month or 86 times a year. The system processed more than 490,000 payments every day.

Around 63% of logins were via the mobile banking app.

Over 90% of cooperative members use e-banking.

## Raiffeisen TWINT continues to enjoy great popularity

More than 1.1 million Raiffeisen clients use the digital Swiss payment solution TWINT in their everyday lives. Cashless payments in e-commerce and shops as well as payments between friends and family grew by over a third in 2023. Until now, TWINT could only be used by clients resident in Switzerland. The TWINT app is now also available to clients living in Switzerland's neighbouring countries. In collaboration with Twint AG, Raiffeisen is constantly optimising and expanding this method of payment with additional functions. In the year under review, for example, the use of client cards in the payment process was simplified.

80% of the 1 million people registered with Raiffeisen TWINT actively use TWINT.


## New debit cards with enhanced functions

The new debit cards have been in use at Raiffeisen since 2022. The existing Maestro and V-Pay cards will be replaced on an ongoing basis by the new Debit Mastercard and Visa Debit cards by 2025. Two thirds of all cardholders received the new debit card by the end of 2023. In addition to being a popular method of payment in shops, the new cards can also be used for online payments. The new feature is becoming increasingly popular. Around 5% of all debit transactions are now used for online purchases.


## New functions for digital payment of QR-bills

Following the successful switch to the QR-bill in autumn 2022, Raiffeisen has made new payment functions available to its e-banking clients. In addition to conventional scanning using the mobile phone camera, QR-bills can now also be shared as a PDF on the smartphone and uploaded quickly and easily to the e-banking app. Raiffeisen is thus further expanding the important connection between the digital and analogue worlds. Advances in the e-bill mean that the fully digital invoicing process is also making steady progress. Around 3 million users in Switzerland already use e-bill. In other words, they receive and pay their bills directly in e-banking.


## Pensions and investments: professional advice and sustainable solutions

The pension and investment business is a particularly important pillar of the Raiffeisen 2025 strategy. The intention is to continue strengthening and expanding this business. The focus is on clients and their financial needs. Raiffeisen provides its clients with access to pension and investment solutions - both in person and digitally. It also aims to make pensions and investment matters more accessible to its clients through personal consultations and in-depth studies. Raiffeisen shows them solutions that offer individual added value depending on their personal circumstances.

Raiffeisen uses the Raiffeisen Pension Barometer to survey the Swiss population's sentiments regard- ing retirement planning each year. Raiffeisen is interested in the extent to which people are aware of the importance of good retirement planning and how much effort they put into it. Raiffeisen also wants to know what people expect from retirement and who they consider to be responsible for their pension matters. This enables Raiffeisen to recognise trends and developments in the Swiss population's sentiments regarding retirement planning. The results show that, despite various mea- sures such as the AHV 21 reform (of old age and survivors' insurance), the financing of the established pension schemes is not assured. This increases the individual responsibility to make financial provision for oneself. While the new options lead to more flexibility, they also result in more complexity, which many people find overwhelming. For this reason, Raiffeisen is committed to raising awareness and providing knowledge about pensions, while also supporting clients closely at all stages of their lives. This enables well-founded decisions to be made, with individuals prepared for their retirement in the best possible way.

Raiffeisen also aims to make pension and investment matters more accessible to its clients through personal consultations and studies.

## Comprehensive financial advisory services

Raiffeisen advises its clients comprehensively on all aspects of financial matters, beyond the traditional financing and investment business. This includes advice in connection with covering risks, planning the financial situation during retirement, and estate planning. In addition, we also offer integrated financial planning for SME owners. The aim here is to ensure the financial stability of the business, while also taking into account the needs of private individuals. Raiffeisen also executes wills on behalf of clients and acts as a proxy for heirs. In the year under review, Raiffeisen inheritance law experts increasingly took on mediation mandates relating to family inheritance disputes. Raiffeisen provided a total of around 15,000 qualified consultations in the above-mentioned specialist topics last year.


## 15,000

specialist consultations are carried out by the financial planning experts on an annual basis.

### Growth in customer deposits

Raiffeisen assists many Swiss residents with wealth planning. Saving money is very important to Raiffeisen clients, whether it is for their retirement or for investments and purchases such as residential property. In 2023, customer deposits at Raiffeisen increased by a total of 1.5% (+CHF 3.1 billion). Raiffeisen manages customer deposits held in around 6 million private, current and savings accounts.

Due to the many years of low interest rates, clients had transferred a significant proportion of their savings account balances to transaction accounts. This was because the interest rate difference between savings accounts with a notice period and transaction accounts without a notice period was very small. Rising market interest rates put an end to this trend. Deposits in transaction accounts decreased by 13% or CHF 11.7 billion in the year under review, with these funds shifting mainly to fixed-interest deposit products. Fixed-interest deposit products such as fixed-term and time deposits with terms of between 1 month and 10 years more than doubled in the year under review (growth of +CHF 14.7 billion). Deposits in conventional savings accounts decreased slightly by 0.6% or CHF 0.5 billion. This trend will change as savings interest rates rise and ordinary bank savings are likely to benefit from shifts out of the transaction area in future.


### Growth in investment business despite challenging market environment

Despite the challenging market environment and the noticeable restraint of clients when investing, the volume of investment business increased by 10.9%. More and more investors are leveraging the benefits of professional asset management and arranging to have their assets managed by Raiffeisen experts. Both the volume and the number of mandates increased by around 25% in the year under review. Raiffeisen has also expanded its range of asset management mandates by launching a mandate for clients domiciled in the Principality of Liechtenstein. The various advisory mandate solutions also became increasingly important in 2023. The volume almost tripled and the number of mandates more than doubled.

The total volume of Raiffeisen funds rose by 15% to CHF 14.7 billion in the year under review. The index-tracking Futura II funds (including pension funds) launched in 2022 performed particularly well. Their volume more than tripled. The volume in the Raiffeisen Gold ETF also more than doubled in the year under review. In addition, "Raiffeisen ETF - Solid Gold Responsibly Sourced & Traceable A USD" won the Swiss ETF Award 2023 in the category "Best Commodity and Precious Metal ETFs and ETPs".

The volume of sustainable Futura funds accounts for over 90% of the total Raiffeisen fund's volume. Including the Raiffeisen ETF - Solid Gold Responsibly Sourced & Traceable, the proportion of sustain- able funds is around 95%.

The capital increase of the Raiffeisen Futura Immo fund paved the way for expanding the fund's real estate portfolio and ensuring sustainable development of the real estate in the fund.


#### Simplification of service prices for investing

To reduce the complexity of the tariffs in the investment business and to make the tariffs simpler and more client friendly, the service prices for investing were revised and simplified with effect from 1 January 2023. In addition, the tariffs for smaller orders (under CHF 25,000) were reduced slightly.

Variable and fixed- interest customer deposits gain in impor- tance after interest rate turnaround.

### Pension products and solutions

Raiffeisen's pension solutions are aligned with client needs and support forward-looking and sus- tainable wealth creation. In 2023, the number of pillar 3a accounts grew by over 33,000 to 713,870 (+4.8%). The digital pillar 3a that was launched in autumn 2021 has become established. Around 17% of new pension accounts were opened online in 2023. Retirement savings in deposits and linked to securities increased by 5.45% (+CHF 1.01 billion) to reach CHF 19.5 billion. Deposits in vested benefit accounts including fund savings plans came close to CHF 5.5 billion by the end of the year under review, a higher level (+CHF 3.5 million) than the previous year.

Raiffeisen expects pension and vested assets under management to stagnate in the coming years. Most of the baby boomer generation (born between 1946 and 1964) is now retired, removing a significant proportion of pension savers from the market. Raiffeisen also found that almost 30% of pension clients with an existing 3a pension account do not make regular payments into their pillar 3a account. Non-payers miss several opportunities all at the same time: tax savings, preferential interest rates, potential returns from pension funds and, above all, any existing gaps in retirement provision cannot be reduced. Around 22% of the people who pay into their pillar 3a account use investment solutions.

Holders of pension and vested benefits accounts also benefited from the turnaround in interest rates in 2023. Raiffeisen increased the interest rate for assets in 3a pension accounts from 0.30 to 1.20% in 2023, and for vested benefits accounts from 0.01 to 0.80%.

Despite the more attractive interest rates on account balances, a relatively large number of clients continued to opt for securities-linked savings in 2023 and invested their pension assets in actively managed or index-linked pension funds. The number of securities-linked pension solutions (pillar 3a) rose by 9.5%, but stagnated for securities-linked vested benefits. The volume of securities-linked pension provision (pillar 3a) grew at an encouraging 23.1%, with the figure at 12.3% for securities- linked vested benefits.


### Co-operation in the insurance business

The cooperation with our partner die Mobiliar is performing well. The focus remains on local coop- eration between the Raiffeisen banks and die Mobiliar general agencies, which have been working together in the market since the start of the collaboration three years ago by brokering banking, pension and insurance products. Sales figures increased further in the year under review, with a growth rate of around 40% achieved in life insurance policies over the period of the cooperation. This is more than satisfactory, especially in a stagnating market environment. The number of insurance policies taken out also increased in the property insurance and corporate client segments.

In the second half of 2023, Raiffeisen also decided to work with a second insurance partner going forward, in order to meet the demands of local market cultivation and client needs even better. The collaboration with Helvetia starts in 2024 and will be an ideal complement to the existing collaboration with die Mobiliar.

Clients can rely on a fair business relationship with Raiffeisen.

## Home and financing: optimal support for home owners

Raiffeisen is one of the leading banks in Switzerland for home financing. The banking group has steadily expanded its market position in the home segment in recent years by adding to its range of solutions: search, buy, finance, renovate, sell. In a focused development of the mortgage business, Raiffeisen intends to set itself apart through comprehensive home ownership advice as well as bank and related solutions. In doing so, it is relying on its own digital channels. For this purpose, it is investing in enhancing its digital presence at raiffeisen.ch. Raiffeisen is also pressing ahead with digitalisation of the mortgage process as well as simple self-service procedures. The digital offering is aimed at boosting efficiency in standard processes and thus creating more capacity for personal home ownership advice.

Finding, financing, renovating and selling real estate - all this is part of Raiffeisen's range of solutions.


## Strong mortgage business

Mortgage loans increased by 3.6% last year to reach CHF 211.0 billion, once again in line with the rest of the market. There is still demand for private residential property, despite the turnaround in interest rates.

Roughly one in every five mortgages in Switzerland originates from a Raiffeisen bank.

The changed interest rate environment increased interest in Saron mortgages.

The change in the interest rate environment has led to "SARON Flex" mortgages continuing to attract much interest from clients. The proportion of "SARON Flex" mortgages increased by 23.2% to CHF 46.7 billion in the period under review. At CHF 158.4 billion, fixed-rate mortgages accounted for the largest share (75.1%) of the total mortgage volume at the end of 2023. There is hardly any demand for variable-rate mortgages. As a result, their volume has almost halved in the past 10 years.

### Home and sustainability

Private home owners are becoming increasingly interested in and aware about the energy efficiency of their property and renewable energy. This is reflected in a noticeable increase in demand for photovoltaic systems and renewable heating systems.

Raiffeisen integrated the energy efficiency evaluation of properties into its advisory services as early as 2015. The banking group also supports the Renewable Heating promotion programme, which assists home owners in switching to renewable energy. Raiffeisen uses its market position to point clients to the free offer of professional incentive consulting as part of the campaign "Renewable heating incentive consulting", thus supporting them in the switch to renewable energy.

Raiffeisen supports its clients in upgrading the energy efficiency of their property.

Raiffeisen Group Annual Report 2023


## Corporate clients business expanded

The corporate clients business is a strategic business area for the Raiffeisen Group that is earmarked for further expansion. Qualitative growth and the market position were improved in the year under review. The year 2023 saw an increase in both the client base and the volume of assets. Adjusted for the Covid-19 loans, the lending volume in the corporate clients business increased by CHF 3.2 billion to CHF 48.1 billion. Local roots, with support available at nearby locations, combined with access to an extensive, Switzerland-wide network of experts at Raiffeisen Switzerland's seven corporate client centres in Lausanne, Burgdorf, Basel, Lucerne, Zurich, Lugano (since December 2023) and St. Gallen, provide Raiffeisen with a unique selling proposition in the market. Due to this unique combination, the corporate clients business can make a significant contribution to the Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025.


## Progress of Covid-19 loans

The repayment of Covid-19 loans is progressing according to plan. With the inclusion of reclaims from the guarantee cooperatives for defaulted loans, a total of around 67% of the disbursed Covid-19 loans were repaid by the end of 2023. In addition, 98% of all scheduled mandatory payments were made on time. As at 31 December 2023, the credit portfolio consisting of Covid-19 and Covid-19-Plus financing is as follows:

The repayments of the disbursed Covid-19 loans are on schedule.

## Launch of Multibanking International

The complete SME eServices solution for multibanking-enabled payments and efficient cash man- agement has been highly popular among corporate clients since the end of 2021. The customisable user interface enables corporate clients to manage their payments and liquidity across banks. The new "Multibanking International" features enable clients to integrate their accounts held abroad into the platform by using Swift.


## Raiffeisen Business Owner Centre

Raiffeisen brings together its support for companies in issues beyond the traditional banking business in its Raiffeisen Business Owner Centre (Raiffeisen Unternehmerzentrum, RUZ). The advisors, all of whom are or have been business owners themselves, provide practical and comprehensive support for other business owners. They focus on the four core topics of Strategy and Business Models, Leadership and Communication, Financing Support, and Succession.

Raiffeisen continues to expand its market position in the corporate clients business.


### Treasury & Markets

As the central control unit, Treasury & Markets ensures access to the capital market, centralised liquidity management and sustainable refinancing, as well as hedging interest rate and currency risks for the Raiffeisen Group. Treasury & Markets is the service provider for precious metals, foreign exchange, securities and structured products within the cooperative union.

Treasury & Markets supplies the Raiffeisen Group with cash in Swiss francs and foreign currencies from more than 100 countries from its own cash centre. The cash logistics service does not just deliver to Raiffeisen banks, it also provides a home delivery service for clients. This service is available via Raiffeisen e-banking, allowing clients to order bank notes in Swiss francs or foreign currencies to be delivered safely and conveniently to their home address. This service was again in great demand in the year under review and has stabilised at a pre-Covid level.

The other main tasks of Treasury & Markets include advising Raiffeisen banks on balance sheet structure management. Raiffeisen banks can also count on the expertise of Treasury & Markets in foreign exchange transactions and in the sale of structured products.


#### Active player in the Swiss capital market

Raiffeisen succeeded in further expanding its position in the Swiss bond market as a lead manager in 2023. Raiffeisen successfully took on the role of lead manager to support several public-sector issuers as well as corporates with their bond issues in Swiss francs. As the joint-lead manager for the Swiss Pfandbriefbank, Raiffeisen placed a substantial share of the issue volume with institutional investors.

The rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) raised its rating for Raiffeisen Switzerland in April 2023 and upgraded the bank's long-term issuer credit rating from A+ to AA -. S&P raised the short-term issuer credit rating from A-1 to A-1+. These ratings were confirmed by S&P in December 2023, with a stable outlook. This very good rating places Raiffeisen among the highest rated banks in the world.


## Raiffeisen Switzerland becomes a member of the London Bullion Market Association

In recent years, Raiffeisen Switzerland has seen increased demand from clients and significant growth in precious metals trading. With its membership of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), Raiffeisen Switzerland is now consolidating its competence in precious metals trading. As the biggest internationally recognised industry association for precious metals, the LBMA sets market standards and also shapes the future alignment of the precious metals industry with regard to the environment, social policy and responsible corporate governance (ESG). This includes in particular the responsible procurement of precious metals. Raiffeisen only sells gold ingots from refineries that satisfy the LBMA's Good Delivery Standards.


### Award for sustainable gold ETF

In November 2023, the "Raiffeisen ETF - Solid Gold Responsibly Sourced & Traceable A USD" again won the Swiss ETF Award 2023, this time in the category "Best Commodity and Precious Metal ETFs and ETPs". The Swiss ETF Awards recognise the exceptional expertise of individual issuers and reward outstanding achievements and innovations in the Swiss world of ETFs and ETPs. This award for the ETF launched in 2021, on physically deposited, traceable gold from responsible mining, is confirmation of the strategy implemented by Raiffeisen to strengthen the sustainability of its products and services. The investment volume of CHF 583 million as at the end of 2023 underlines the investor interest in these sustainable investments.

Clients are increasingly using e-banking to place an order for cash delivered to their home.

The rating agency Standard & Poor's awards the Raiffeisen Group a very good rating.

SME eServices, Raiffeisen's multibanking platform, launches a new feature that allows third-party bank accounts abroad to be integrated.

Raiffeisen Group Annual Report 2023

Structured products

The focus for structured products in 2023 was on yield optimisation and capital protection. The reversal from a negative interest rate environment to positive interest rates made it possible to achieve 100% capital protection while also participating in positive market performance. There was also demand for securities with a fixed-interest structure.

The assessment of the underlying assets of structured products with regard to ESG criteria is carried out by the independent Swiss sustainability rating agency Inrate. In the case of structured products that meet the sustainability criteria of the Raiffeisen Futura label, Raiffeisen regularly checks compli- ance with the Futura criteria throughout the product's lifetime.

As part of the strategic strengthening of the pension and investment business, Raiffeisen is developing its own issuance platform for structured products, "Raiffeisen Structify". In the future, Raiffeisen will be able to issue, hedge and sell its structured products itself, thus covering the entire value chain. The platform will be gradually established at the Raiffeisen banks from 2024 onwards. With Raiffeisen Structify, client advisors will be able to issue customised structured products from Raiffeisen directly on the bank's own platform.

By developing its own product capacity, Raiffeisen is in the position to cover the needs of its clients in the investment sector even better, thus expanding its position as a top provider of investment products.

Raiffeisen is one of the biggest issuers of structured products in the Swiss market and is the proud two-time winner at the Swiss Derivative Awards 2023 in the categories "Best Equity Product" and "Top Service".

Going forward, Raiffeisen will issue its structured products through its own platform: Raiffeisen Structify.

Sustainability

Sustainability is one of Raiffeisen's corporate values along with credibility, client proximity and entrepreneurship, and is part of the Group strategy. Guided by a responsible business model, Raiffeisen strives to continuously improve its sustainability performance and disclose sustainability information.

Raiffeisen Group Annual Report 2023


## Sustainability strategy

Sustainability has long been a corporate value at Raiffeisen, forming a central element of the Group strategy Raiffeisen 2025. It is integrated into this strategy as one of six approaches: "We set ourselves apart as a sustainable cooperative." For Raiffeisen, sustainability means acting responsibly and con- sidering the ecological and social impact of its business activities, in addition to the economic effects.

A Raiffeisen sustainability strategy was developed on the basis of the Group strategy, and has been formally incorporated since 2022. The sustainability strategy defines two key action areas "Strengthen sustainability management" and "Achieving impact". It comprises a total of 10 focus topics on which Raiffeisen concentrates when strengthening its sustainability performance. The sustainability strategy is based on a completed materiality analysis and takes into account the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), the results of the impact analysis from 2022 and regulatory developments. It thus not only addresses sustainability issues that are significant to the Raiffeisen Group's sustainability in accordance with "dual materiality", but also sustainability issues on which the Raiffeisen Group has a significant impact. The sustainability strategy is discussed every year during a stakeholder dialogue.

Sustainability is a central element of the Group strategy.

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->


### Materiality analysis as the core of the sustainability strategy

A survey of internal and external stakeholders as well as independent sustainability experts conducted in 2018 identified key issues for Raiffeisen in the context of sustainability. In this materiality analysis, respondents assessed the extent to which an issue affects Raiffeisen as a sustainable company, and which issues Raiffeisen should focus on to become more sustainable.

Topics with a high impact on Raiffeisen are considered "material".

The result of the analysis is presented in the materiality matrix. The key issues are discussed each year during the Raiffeisen stakeholder dialogue. Once again in 2023, it was confirmed that both the focus topics and the sustainability goals that have been set are still relevant. In the context of updating the material topics, impact considerations, which are based, among other factors, on the results of the PRB impact analysis are also incorporated.


#### Principles for Responsible Banking and impact analysis

In addition to the materiality analysis, the six Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) of the United Nations Environment Programme - Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI) have also been incorporated into the definition of the strategic focus topics.

Based on the methodology provided by UNEP-FI, Raiffeisen conducted an analysis of the positive and negative effects of its business activities on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2022. The results of this PRB impact analysis confirmed, in particular, the focus of Raiffeisen's sustainability strategy on "Climate" and showed that the strategic direction is appropriate. The analysis also pointed

The 10 focus topics for sustainability 2020-2025


## Strengthen sustainability management

2 - Strengthen governance Management structures and processes are intended to ensure the implementation of corporate social responsibility and sustainability in the Raiffeisen Group.

3 - Involve external stakeholders Raiffeisen regularly and systematically engages in dialogue with stakeholders, consults them when identifying relevant issues and works together with them on the path towards a sustainable Switzerland.


### 4 - Ensure transparency

Raiffeisen discloses how corporate social respon- sibility and sustainability are implemented in the company and in its products.

5 - Responsibility in business conduct In the spirit of responsible business activity, Raiffeisen complies with applicable laws and Swiss values, including human rights, and adheres to voluntary agreements.

6 - Create sustainable products and services Raiffeisen products and services are intended to be compatible with sustainable development.


#### 1 - Set strategic goals

Raiffeisen identifies the issues that are material for its long-term success and for strengthening positive and reducing negative effects on sustainable development. It sets clear goals and defines actions for these issues.

10 - Promote employee expertise and diversity

Raiffeisen creates comprehensive and ongoing continuing education and development oppor- tunities. At Raiffeisen, the diversity in society is reflected in the company. Discrimination will not be tolerated in any way.

9 - Maintain open and fair interaction with clients

to other possible fields of action in "Resources and waste" as well as "Soil and biodiversity". Raiffeisen will analyse the relevant interdependencies in more detail in the coming years. Raiffeisen publishes the results of the impact analysis and information on the current status of implementing the principles annually in a separate PRB report.


## Regulatory developments and expectations

Lastly, considerations regarding regulatory developments have also been incorporated into the sus- tainability strategy. Raiffeisen gathers relevant information by monitoring political and regulatory processes and by participating in industry associations. From a regulatory viewpoint, the focus is particularly on the new disclosure requirements in the Swiss Code of Obligations and in specific regulations, which also express a certain expectation of "responsible business conduct". From a banking perspective, industry initiatives in 2023 such as self-regulation of the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) and the Asset Management Association Switzerland (AMAS) in the area of Sustainable Finance also play an important role.


## Assessment of strategy implementation

By implementing its sustainability strategy, Raiffeisen aims to make improvements in its key environ- mental and social issues, implement the Principles for Responsible Banking, meet the expectations of responsible business conduct, and thus also minimise sustainability risks. This creates the conditions for setting ourselves apart as a sustainable and responsible cooperative. The following statements on the 10 focus areas, in particular the trend in the relevant key figures, show that Raiffeisen made further progress in achieving these goals in the year under review.


## Sustainable Development Goals - the UN's SDGs

The UN Sustainable Development Goals are primarily intended for states. However, they also call on all players around the world to do their bit for sustainable development. In light of its status as a banking group with a very high market share in real estate financing, Raiffeisen wishes to make its contribution. Raiffeisen is, therefore, affected in particular by SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and by SDG 13 (climate action), and aims to make a positive contribution in these areas as well as reducing negative impacts.


## Sustainability governance

Effective sustainability management requires appropriate organisational structures, processes and responsibilities. The responsibilities for sustainability are spread across several levels in the Raiffeisen Group.

Raiffeisen Switzerland has responsibility at Group level for the strategic direction when it comes to sustainability and for disclosing sustainability information. It takes sustainability factors into account in risk management and continues to develop the range of sustainable products and services. Raiffeisen Switzerland also communicates with internal and external stakeholders as well as the general public with regard to sustainability issues. In addition, it advises and supports the 219 Raiffeisen banks on various sustainability-related issues. The Raiffeisen banks put sustainability into practice on a local level and take their own measures in their regional and local context. The Raiffeisen banks can be involved in issues relating to the overarching management of corporate responsibility and sustainability through the relevant specialist committees. Furthermore, there is the option of exchang- ing information with the Raiffeisen Bank Council with regard to fundamental strategic issues. Within Raiffeisen Switzerland, the Board of Directors regularly deals with the Group's sustainability issues, both as a full Board and in its individual committees. The Executive Board of Raiffeisen Switzerland, supported by the respective departments, implements the guidelines defined by the Board of Directors and makes the relevant operational decisions regarding sustainability. The Sustainability, Policy & Cooperative department reports to Raiffeisen Switzerland's Head of Executive Staff. It acts as an internal and external point of contact for sustainability issues. Within the focus topics of the sustain- ability strategy, it also implements strategic projects that create momentum and boost the

The Sustainability, Policy & Cooperative depart- ment creates momentum to boost sustainability performance.

<!-- PageNumber="54" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

Raiffeisen Group's sustainability performance. It is responsible for monitoring and sustainability reporting, and bears specialist responsibility for climate and environmental management. It is also responsible for the due diligence check to ensure responsible business conduct. The department reports to the Executive Board and the Board of Directors' Strategy and Innovation Committee at least twice a year, and at least once a year to the full Board of Directors. In addition to and in coop- eration with the Sustainability, Policy & Cooperative department, which has overall responsibility for sustainability, other units deal with specific aspects of sustainability. For example, Risk Control deals with financial risks caused by ESG factors, including climate-related financial risks. The Human Resources unit is responsible for diversity. The Competence Centre for Sustainability, Investing & Retirement department, which is part of the Investment & Retirement Centre, is responsible for sustainability aspects in connection with investments and retirement. In particular, this includes the Futura Policy for sustainable pension and investment solutions, including "active ownership" and investor dialogue, as well as training for investment and pension client advisors.


## Action area "Strengthen sustainability management"

The sustainability strategy and objectives, together with the regular involvement of stakeholders, create the conditions for adequate measurement of progress. Comprehensive disclosure ensures that progress and challenges are reported. Lastly, it must be possible to ensure responsible business conduct through various instruments and approaches.


## 1 - Set strategic goals

Objective of the focus topic

Raiffeisen identifies the issues that are material for its long-term success and for strengthening positive and reduc- ing negative effects on sustainable development. It sets clear goals and defines actions for these issues.

To strengthen our sustainability performance, Raiffeisen sets itself targets for the 10 focus topics in the sustainability strategy. The targets were defined when the sustainability strategy was formulated, and formally adopted in 2022. Sustainability targets were selectively enhanced and consolidated at operational level in the year under review. For example, climate reduction targets were re-calculated with 2022 as base year.

The following tables at the beginning of each section indicate the objectives of the focus topics and provide an overview of the major milestones achieved in the year under review. Explicit impact indicators are additionally provided in the action area "Achieving impact".


## 2 - Strengthen governance

Sustainability is a cross-cutting issue. Because of this, a key aspect is cooperation between the Sustainability, Policy & Cooperative department, which has overall responsibility for the topic, and various units. Against this background, the department has been formally involved in various processes over the past few years, thus systematically incorporating sustainability considerations. For example, the department has been involved in the process of introducing or discontinuing products and services. It has also been participating in Positioning and Risk Meetings (PRM) at the Investment & Retirement Centre on the topic of Impact since 2022, and in the Sustainable Investing specialist committee.

In the year under review, Raiffeisen revised the policies of the independent whistleblower office and the associated tasks, scope of authority and responsibilities. Until now, employees and executive bodies of Raiffeisen Switzerland have been able to report suspected internal abuses or misconduct at Raiffeisen to an external whistleblowing office. Since 2023, Raiffeisen banks and subsidiaries of Raiffeisen Switzerland have also been able to submit reports. A report is treated confidentially and can be made anonymously or include the name. The purpose of the whistleblowing office is to detect any critical situations at an early stage, conduct internal investigations if necessary, and deal with any weak points. An internal directive also aims to protect whistleblowers acting in good faith from "retaliatory measures" (dismissal, demotion, discrimination, etc.) and to recognise and properly address any risks in connection with the reported circumstances at an early stage. As part of standard report- ing, statistical data on whistleblowing is presented to the Executive Board, the Risk Committee and the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland at least every six months.

The sustainability strategy also envisages integrating the Raiffeisen banks even more closely into the strategically agreed implementation of sustainability, through more intensive dialogue. This should strengthen the shared understanding of sustainability in the Raiffeisen Group and drive forward implementation of the strategy. The relevant conceptual work was driven forward in the year under review.

### Dialogue with stakeholders

Regular and open dialogue with its internal and external stakeholders is extremely important to Raiffeisen. Thanks to their cooperative independence, the Raiffeisen banks are very close to their clients. Through their local presence, the banks are closely connected to local and regional stake- holders and are able to conduct regular dialogue.

At the level of Raiffeisen Switzerland, the most important internal and external stakeholders are invited to participate in dialogue at least once a year. Once again in 2023, the key sustainability issues and the sustainability strategy were reviewed and confirmed at this Raiffeisen stakeholder dialogue (see materiality matrix). Participating organisations included Agrocleantech, Energy Model Zurich, the Raiffeisen Bank Council and Swiss Sustainable Finance. The participants in this year's stakeholder dialogue praised Raiffeisen's transparent sustainability reporting and its first external audit with limited assurance in accordance with GRI standards by Ernst & Young Switzerland (EY). Raiffeisen's strategic projects were welcomed, for example, those concerning Group-wide climate strategy or aimed at closer cooperation at Group level on the issue of sustainability.


## Memberships

Raiffeisen has institutionalised its exchange with various stakeholders and its commitment to a sustainable Switzerland through activities such as memberships. It is represented as a member in the following national and international organisations, committees and initiatives focused on sustainability:

\- Swiss Sustainable Business Association (öbu), since 2007

\- Swiss Climate Foundation (founding member), since 2008 - Zurich Energy Model as a member of the Energy Agency for Industry (ENAW), since 2013

\- Swiss Sustainable Finance (founding member), since 2014

\- Green and Sustainable Finance Working Group of the European Association of Cooperative Banks, since 2018

<!-- PageNumber="56" -->

\- Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), since 2023

\- Sustainable Finance expert commission and working group of the Swiss Bankers Association, since 2023

These memberships also provided Raiffeisen with major impetus in the year under review, reaffirmed the strategic focus and reinforced the direction in which it is heading.

A new addition in the year under review was membership of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), an alliance coordinated by UNEP-FI. As a result of joining the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA), Raiffeisen also became a member of the SBA's Sustainable Finance expert commission and working group in the year under review.

Raiffeisen has joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance.

Commitment to business, culture and sport throughout Switzerland Raiffeisen has local roots throughout Switzerland due to its decentralised business model comprising 219 Raiffeisen banks. In addition to Raiffeisen Switzerland's national commitment, the dialogue with local stakeholders from business, culture and sport, and their local support by the Raiffeisen banks, is likewise very important for the Raiffeisen Group. The banking group's broadly based commitment to society supports the goal of a sustainable Switzerland and positively impacts the daily lives of clients and external stakeholders (such as associations and initiatives). It also strengthens the Raiffeisen brand across the whole of Switzerland.

The decentralised approach is especially apparent in our sponsorship commitments. In addition to the existing national sponsorship of the Swiss ski association Swiss Ski since 2005, this can be seen, for example, in our regional support for around 20,000 young skiers. Raiffeisen also remains strongly committed to the Swiss Museum Pass, through which Raiffeisen members receive free access to more than 500 partner museums throughout Switzerland. Raiffeisen has been a premium partner of Special Olympics Switzerland since 2023. Through this commitment, Raiffeisen aims to promote inclusion in Swiss sport and raise the visibility of athletes with disabilities.

Since 2016, Raiffeisen has provided a free platform for financing local projects through donations, lokalhelden.ch. True to the spirit of the banking group's cooperative principle, through ] lokalhelden.ch Raiffeisen takes a local and regional approach to crowdfunding, making an important contribution to diversity in Switzerland in terms of sport, culture and social aspects. In addition to the large number of local donations from various Raiffeisen banks, Raiffeisen also offers sponsorship programmes for associations and supra-regional projects. By the end of 2023, a total of more than CHF 42 million in donations had been raised through £ lokalhelden.ch for more than 2,400 projects. In December 2023, Raiffeisen raised CHF 400,000 through 2] lokalhelden.ch for Swiss Solidarity during a Christmas fundraising drive for the benefit of children and young people, matching each donation up to a total amount of CHF 200,000.

The Raiffeisen Group's sponsorships amount to roughly CHF 25 million per year. Economic, social and cultural contributions and donations additionally amount to more than CHF 6 million.

Raiffeisen also wants to enable its employees to get directly involved in cultural, sporting and social causes. Raiffeisen therefore gives its employees time to participate in public services, including during working hours, in line with the employment regulations and after consulting their line manager.

### Support for the political militia system

A functioning political system and dialogue with political stakeholders is important to Raiffeisen as a decentralised cooperative group with a presence throughout Switzerland. As in previous years, Raiffeisen once again contributed to a healthy Swiss political system based on the militia concept through its party financing in the year under review. Raiffeisen contributes a total of CHF 246,000 annually to all parties represented in the Swiss Federal Assembly. This amount is split equally between the National Council and the Council of States and is distributed to the parties according to the number of seats. This takes account of the equivalence of the two chambers as well as the federal/decentralised system of government in Switzerland. The parties have no accountability obli- gations in relation to the use of the funds and the payment is not linked to political goodwill or voting behaviour. In the 2023 election campaign year, Raiffeisen Switzerland also made campaign donations totalling CHF 180,000. This support was likewise not linked to political goodwill, voting behaviour or a particular party affiliation.


## 4 - Ensure transparency

| Objective of the focus topic || Milestones 2023 |
| - | - | - |
| | Develop and professionalise reporting in line with common standards and memberships | - External audit with limited assurance of sustainability reporting in accordance with GRI standards by Ernst & Young Switzerland (EY) - Publication of the second Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) report |

Raiffeisen's stakeholders, especially the more than 2 million cooperative members, should be able to obtain information about Raiffeisen's commitment in terms of sustainability and responsibility. Accord- ingly, Raiffeisen aims to meet high standards when disclosing its sustainability performance and for years has been implementing the globally recognised standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for sustainability reporting. Raiffeisen regularly reviews the extent to which further reporting standards should be taken into account.

Provisions referring to transparency regarding non-financial matters came into force on 1 January 2022 in Switzerland too, through Art. 964a ff. of the Swiss Code of Obligations (OR). The Raiffeisen Group is affected by this amendment to the law and must meet this obligation. It discloses its non-financial matters as part of this Annual Report, including the notes, in accordance with the statutory provisions. Raiffeisen already complies with the subject-specific legal disclosure obligations in line with the "Ordinance on Mandatory Climate Disclosures for Large Companies", which came into force on 1 January 2024. Climate reporting has been carried out separately since 2022 in the note ] "Disclosure of climate information in accordance with the recommendations of the TCFD".

Raiffeisen's non-financial disclosure underwent an external audit with limited assurance in accordance with GRI standards by Ernst & Young Switzerland (EY) in 2023 for the first time. Raiffeisen thoroughly analysed the findings and recommendations of the audit firm in the year under review and developed appropriate measures to further strengthen disclosure.

Furthermore, in 2023 Raiffeisen published the second report entitled £ Principles for Responsible Banking - Reporting and Self-Assessment on the implementation of these principles.

Raiffeisen's non-financial reporting for the 2023 financial year was approved by the Board of Directors. It will be submitted to the General Meeting of Raiffeisen Switzerland for a vote.

## 5 - Responsibility in business conduct

| - | - | - |
| | activity, Raiffeisen complies with applicable laws and Swiss values, including human rights, and adheres to voluntary agreements.| In the spirit of responsible business - Group-wide introduction of due diligence check on responsible  business conduct |

As a banking group with a cooperative structure, Raiffeisen is committed to conducting its business operations responsibly. Firstly, this includes ensuring compliance. As a bank, combating corruption and preventing money laundering as well as dealing with tax issues is particularly relevant to Raiffeisen in this context. Responsible business conduct also includes the systematic inclusion of environmental, social and governance factors in risk management. In addition, a due diligence check is made to analyse whether relevant business relationships could be linked to serious negative impacts on the environment and society. On the basis of the new disclosure requirements applicable in Switzerland, information must be provided in this context, in particular on handling the issues of precious metals from conflict areas, child labour and human rights. Other aspects of responsible business conduct include specific tools such as a whistleblowing office and a supplier code of conduct.


### Ensuring compliance

The banking industry in Switzerland is highly regulated. The Raiffeisen Group adheres to the statutory, regulatory and professional requirements and processes applicable in the financial centre. As a cooperative bank, Raiffeisen focuses on the Swiss retail market. The Swiss legal system and regulatory regime in particular are therefore applicable to Raiffeisen. Raiffeisen's comprehensive compliance monitoring ensures that national and international requirements are met. The focus here includes the relevant regulations for combating corruption, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Raiffeisen Group did not record any significant breaches of laws and regulations in the year under review. Fines of this nature were accordingly not imposed on the Raiffeisen Group (see table "Social compliance and anti-corruption measures", 2] page 61).

Raiffeisen Switzerland's Legal & Compliance department monitors changes in legal and compliance risks for the entire Group. It reports the main changes in these risks every three months to the Executive Board of Raiffeisen Switzerland and to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee at Raiffeisen Switzer- land. Once a year, the department reports on the focus risks to the entire Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland and draws up a risk-orientated action plan to mitigate these risks.

Compliance with the relevant regulations is ensured through the three-lines-of-defence model within the Raiffeisen Group. Raiffeisen banks provide the first line of defence through their front office staff and back office functions, and the second line of defence through the specialist officers for compliance issues (anti-money laundering officers, compliance officers and responsible officers). Raiffeisen Switzer- land performs further higher-level duties for the second line of defence in the context of system responsibility. In particular, this includes preparing and maintaining the Group-wide compliance regulations, training the Raiffeisen banks' internal officers, and safeguarding the reporting line. Internal Auditing forms the third line of defence. Internal Group processes ensure the necessary control and monitoring as well as risk management.

More information on dealing with legal and compliance risks is available in the chapter "Risk report", 5 pages 94-105.

#### Prevention of corruption and money laundering

The regulator ascribes a particularly high level of importance to the fight against corruption, money laundering and terrorism financing. Raiffeisen does not engage in any business activities that pose an unacceptably high risk of money laundering, fraud, sanctions or corruption. The Raiffeisen Group takes extensive preventative measures to counter these risks. These include monitoring business relationships and transactions, along with raising employees' awareness on an ongoing basis. Raiffeisen Switzerland has clear guidelines on the prevention of money laundering and corruption. Specific employees of Raiffeisen Switzerland receive regular mandatory training on combating money laundering. All Raiffeisen Switzerland employees are offered training on combating corruption. Employees and members of the Board of Directors of the Raiffeisen banks receive function-specific mandatory training on combating money laundering. Anti-corruption responsibilities are defined at all levels of the hierarchy in the Raiffeisen Group, are enshrined in internal policies and assumed within the business areas of the individual Raiffeisen banks. Strict internal policies govern entry into business relationships with politically exposed persons, the combating of money laundering and terrorism financing, and adherence to laws in the area of economic and trade sanctions.

Internal guidelines on conflicts of interest and the avoidance of bribery are enshrined in the employ- ment regulations. All employees of Raiffeisen Switzerland and the Raiffeisen Pension Fund Cooperative, as well as all members of supervisory bodies, are issued with the employment regulations and, by signing the employment contract or mandate agreement, confirm that they are aware of the above-mentioned requirements. Employees of the Raiffeisen banks either receive the employment regulations of Raiffeisen Switzerland or equivalent regulations from the respective Raiffeisen bank. Business partners who supply goods or services to Raiffeisen are sensitised to anti-corruption issues via the Supplier Code. This explicitly stipulates that any form of corruption, bribery, money laundering, extortion, embezzlement or pay-off is prohibited and must be prevented. General standards and the internal anti-corruption guidelines are an integral part of Raiffeisen Switzerland's internal regulatory system. They are subject to internal audit and, where regulatory aspects are involved, external reg- ulatory audits as well.

In addition to Raiffeisen Switzerland, the Raiffeisen banks are directly responsible for taking action to prevent money laundering. Each Raiffeisen bank has a person in charge of money laundering issues. These individuals receive annual training on specific topics from Raiffeisen Switzerland and are also professionally supported in their work. If money laundering or terrorism financing is suspected, the Raiffeisen banks' anti-money laundering officers report to the Money Laundering Reporting Office. Raiffeisen Switzerland coordinates the further course of action and supports the Raiffeisen banks in implementing the necessary measures.

The Raiffeisen banks regularly conduct analyses of risks associated with money laundering and ter- rorism financing for the Executive Board according to Raiffeisen Switzerland guidelines, and also send their reports to Raiffeisen Switzerland. Raiffeisen Switzerland's Legal & Compliance department monitors the changes in these risks across the entire Group, and reports material risks to the Risk Committee and the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland every quarter. The Board of Directors bears strategic responsibility at the highest level for the adequacy of its measures to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.

The employment regula- tions contain guidelines on preventing conflicts of interest and bribery attempts.

Responsible handling of tax matters

In line with its comprehensive sustainability strategy, the Raiffeisen Group aims to comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements in relation to taxation. If any matter is unclear, Raiffeisen consults external tax advisors or obtains binding tax information from the relevant tax authorities, with whom Raiffeisen maintains a constructive dialogue. Raiffeisen Switzerland also supports the Raiffeisen banks in tax matters as required, in order to ensure that tax is declared correctly.

The Raiffeisen Group has a foreign subsidiary, Raiffeisen Switzerland B.V., based in the Netherlands. It issues structured products but has no direct clients. Raiffeisen's effective tax rate in the Netherlands is significantly higher than the 15% required by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its global minimum taxation requirements, and is also higher than the rate in Switzerland. Intragroup services ("transfer pricing") between Raiffeisen Switzerland Cooperative and Raiffeisen Switzerland B.V. are charged at arm's length prices. There is no base erosion or profit shifting. Furthermore, Raiffeisen prepares an annual country-by-country report for the relevant tax authorities, enabling them to assess the transfer prices.

The Raiffeisen Group does not assist in tax evasion. It refrains from any and all acts and statements that might help clients in any way to evade the proper taxation of assets. Raiffeisen will not accept any assets if it knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect that these were not properly declared and taxed in the client's country of tax residence. Appropriate directives and instructions are in place and the requirements are communicated in regular training. Moreover, by accepting the General Terms and Conditions of Business, all clients confirm that they comply at all times with all statutory regulations applicable to them (including tax laws).

As a domestic retail bank, Raiffeisen has only a small proportion of foreign clients. These come pri- marily from neighbouring countries and almost entirely from countries with which Switzerland has agreed to the automatic exchange of information. As a result, the financial information is transmitted annually to the tax authorities in the country where the client is resident for tax purposes. Raiffeisen also offers country-specific tax reports, which are aimed at clients whose place of residence/tax domicile is in neighbouring countries. The tax report provides an overview of all relevant products and business transactions according to the country-specific tax law, thus supporting clients with their tax returns. However, Raiffeisen does not provide tax advice to clients whose place of residence/tax domicile is outside Switzerland. The bank refers these clients to external advisors for professional tax advice if required.

## ESG factors in risk management

In the context of risk management, Raiffeisen does not regard environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as a separate risk category but as drivers of existing risks. These include credit, market and operational risks. ESG factors at Raiffeisen are accordingly integrated into the existing Raiffeisen risk management framework. They are thus covered by the Raiffeisen Group's risk strategy, risk tolerance and risk policy and taken into account.

ESG risk matrix

</figure>


Raiffeisen follows and monitors ESG risk drivers continuously to an appropriate extent. The key figures tracked and disclosed as part of the sustainability strategy serve as indicators for the impact of the ESG factors on risks. The Risk Control unit, which is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the risk profile, also takes ESG risk drivers into account in its work.

ESG factors as risk drivers generally have a low impact on Raiffeisen's existing risks at this time, based on an internal risk analysis of all the risk drivers (ESG risk matrix) that was subsequently checked externally for plausibility. Where relevant, they are controlled appropriately by existing measures. This is due to Raiffeisen's business model, with its strong focus on the Swiss retail banking business. This means that Raiffeisen is faced with comparatively few challenges in the areas of the environment, social aspects and governance, and must also comply with Swiss regulations in these areas. As a result, ESG factors are not currently assessed as standard in lending, for example, but on a case-by- case basis (see section entitled "Due diligence check on responsible business conduct"). ESG factors are implicitly taken into account in the valuation of real estate or when assessing the strategy and business model of larger companies.

The risk analysis in the ESG risk matrix is updated each year and reviewed by the interdisciplinary internal ESG Risks committee in order to adequately cover the range of issues. The expert committee supports the general risk management process and is managed by the Operational Risk Control department. The risk analysis in 2023 confirmed that ESG issues have a minor overall impact on Raiffeisen's risks.

The risk analysis for the climate issue is carried out in much greater depth, mainly for regulatory reasons. The relevant results are disclosed separately in the TCFD report (see chapter "Risk report", 5 pages 94-105 and 2 "Disclosure of climate information in accordance with the recommendations of the TCFD").

ESG factors have an impact on existing risk categories. Raiffeisen monitors climate-related financial risks in particular.

Due diligence check on responsible business conduct

In 2021, Raiffeisen Switzerland established a due diligence check to ensure responsible business conduct, based on an analysis of the impact of specific activities on the environment and society. The due diligence check was extended to the entire Group in 2023. By conducting this due diligence check, Raiffeisen aims to avoid causing, contributing to or being associated with serious human rights violations or environmental damage through its business activities. The due diligence process imple- ments the instructions of the Board of Directors, which is responsible for Raiffeisen's business ethics positioning.

The due diligence consists of an initial check by the unit responsible for the transaction. The aim here is to identify transactions with increased risks and have them undergo a more detailed second check by the Sustainability, Policy & Cooperative department. The due diligence check includes clearly defined triggers and risk escalation processes up to the Executive Board. Moreover, companies from certain sectors are generally excluded from credit financing and securities issuance. In some instances, certification or other standards are required for supplier relationships. The due diligence also includes a comprehensive check of the existing business covered by the due diligence (e.g. at portfolio level) by the Sustainability, Policy & Cooperative department. If the check found that transactions had been concluded that were not compatible with responsible business conduct, the due diligence approach would have to be analysed and adjusted if necessary.

The aim of the due diligence check is to identify transactions with increased risks and then conduct an in-depth ESG review of them.

Along with the due diligence process, a content-based guideline and a review system to manage ESG issues in various business activities, including financing, was introduced in the Raiffeisen Group. The binding guideline means that relevant ESG aspects can be taken into account using a risk-based approach when granting loans, for example. It can accordingly be categorised as part of the credit policy on sustainability. More specific, separate guidelines on financing in areas such as forestry (deforestation), mining or the extraction of fossil fuels would not be appropriate in the case of Raiffeisen. Raiffeisen has very limited connections to the above issues. Raiffeisen is a retail bank with a focus on the Swiss market. Raiffeisen's retail, private and corporate clients are almost exclusively domiciled in Switzerland. Switzerland is a well-functioning constitutional state with effectively enforced environmental and social laws. All contents of the due diligence check, including business ethics positioning, are an integral part of Raiffeisen Switzerland's internal regulatory system. They are subject to internal audit and, where regulatory aspects are involved, external regulatory audits as well.

Minerals and metals from conflict areas as part of the due diligence check

By introducing the above-mentioned due diligence check, one of Raiffeisen's aims is to ensure that human rights are respected in connection with the production of the precious metal ingots traded by Raiffeisen. An additional specialist directive also regulates in detail the process and responsibilities around due diligence in connection with the acceptance of physical precious metals. The precious metal ingots traded by Raiffeisen originate exclusively from production facilities accredited by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) or the London Platinum and Palladium Market (LPPM). As part of this accreditation, compliance with the OECD's Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas is also assessed by third parties. When accepting precious metal ingots and coins, Raiffeisen Switzerland has been focusing on a close network of established partner companies for several years now. All ingots bearing the Raiffeisen brand have been produced in accordance with the "Responsibly Sourced and Traceable" approach since April 2021. The gold sourced by the Argor-Heraeus refinery comes from small mines in Colombia, which operate in a conflict zone as defined by the OECD. As a result, these supplier relationships are audited by the Argor-Heraeus refinery specifically in accordance with OECD requirements.

Raiffeisen clients can use the ingot number to trace the origin of the gold used in Raiffeisen ingots.

### Respect for human rights

Due to its business model, Raiffeisen operates almost exclusively in Switzerland. Raiffeisen is conse- quently only exposed to a very limited extent to circumstances that enable human rights violations (e.g. political instability, poverty or the shadow economy). In Switzerland, human rights are also integrated into binding law by means of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution. Swiss law prohibits discrimination, forced labour and child labour, for example. It guarantees dignified working conditions, freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining and equal pay. Raiffeisen recognises these rights, and persons employed by Raiffeisen are protected by Swiss law.

Raiffeisen also reviews compliance with human rights, particularly in the case of business involving foreign sourcing. This is a risk-based procedure done on a case-by-case basis as part of the due dili- gence for responsible business conduct mentioned above. "Risk-based" means that checks are carried out where there is a relevant risk that Raiffeisen could be associated with serious human rights violations. In the case of foreign sourcing, there may be a risk through supplier or other business relationships. On the other hand, Raiffeisen is unlikely to be associated with human rights violations as its business is loan financing, primarily for real estate (mortgages) and SMEs in Switzerland. Overall, the risk of coming into contact with serious human rights violations is comparatively low for Raiffeisen.

Any type of complaint may be submitted to Raiffeisen Switzerland in writing or by telephone. In the event of internal discrimination, a complaint can also be lodged with Human Resources pursuant to the employment policy. Alternatively, there is also an external independent whistleblowing centre to which an affected person can turn (see Section 2, "Strengthen governance", 2] pages 55-56).


#### Supplier Code

The Raiffeisen Supplier Code is part of the formal internal due diligence check introduced in 2021. Raiffeisen expects that its suppliers, their employees and all sub-contractors and their employees will comply with the principles laid down in the Code. The Supplier Code is published on the Raiffeisen website and reference is made to it in the framework agreement between suppliers and Raiffeisen Switzerland.

## Action area "Achieving impact"

The action area "Achieving impact" in the Raiffeisen sustainability strategy comprises the following focus topics: creating sustainable products and services, ensuring long-term economic success, mit- igating climate change, interacting openly and fairly with clients, and promoting employee expertise and diversity. Raiffeisen's sustainability impact is to be strengthened through continuous improvement in these areas.

The Raiffeisen Group takes into account environmental and social factors, as well as increasing client demand with regard to sustainability, when designing and developing its financial products and services - both for private and investment clients as well as for corporate clients.


### Raise client awareness in the mortgage business

When promoting sustainability in the mortgage business, Raiffeisen sees its role primarily in routinely making its clients aware, at an early stage, of the potential for boosting energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions, and presenting appropriate financing solutions. As early as 2015, Raiffeisen was the first Swiss-wide bank to integrate the energy efficiency evaluation of properties as standard procedure into its home ownership advice. Clients can use this to obtain an overview of their property's energy efficiency. Any investment backlog can also be identified and renovation scenarios simulated. In the year under review, 1,145 consultations were carried out based on the Raiffeisen Modernisation Planner (RAImo). This number is expected to continue rising. The various self-service offers in the field of energy efficiency and renovation are also becoming increasingly important. These offers were accessed more than 24,000 times in the year under review.

As in previous years, Raiffeisen supported SwissEnergy's Renewable Heating programme in 2023. This federal programme aims to help private home owners switch to heating systems using renewable energy, by providing neutral and professional advice. As a strategic partner, Raiffeisen provides relevant financial expertise. In the year under review, 2,276 Renewable Heating incentive consultations were carried out.

To implement the "Guidelines for mortgage providers on the promotion of energy efficiency" (in effect from 1 January 2023) issued by the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA), client advisors were systematically trained throughout the Group in the year under review. A modernisation check was also integrated into the processes and advisory applications. This modernisation check identifies energy efficiency and any modernisation backlog. In addition, information on subsidies and technical experts is shown. A dedicated client document sets out the content of the advice provided to clients.

Raiffeisen takes the energy efficiency of properties into account when advising its mortgage clients.

In addition, the Eco mortgage was further developed in the year under review. Until now, the award of a certificate was linked to a Minergie certificate or cantonal energy performance certificate (GEAK certificate). Investments in renewable energy can now also be financed (investment in a renewable heating system, e.g. heat pump, district or solar heating, or wood as a replacement for a fossil heating system, as well as investments in a photovoltaic installation or solar panels for heating water).

1 Programmes to raise home owners' awareness of energy efficiency and climate sustainability are optimised on an ongoing basis, and are replaced or supplemented by new programmes. The thermal imaging campaign was last offered in 2021. Data relating to programmes contin- ued by individual Raiffeisen banks is not available at Group level.

2 In 2022, eValo was replaced by a self-service product at raiffeisencasa.ch, and the national marketing campaign "Renewable Heating incentive consultations" was added.

3 The Raiffeisen modernisation planner was launched in March 2021.

4 The data on the two self-service products at raiffeisencasa.ch has only been collected since 2022.


### Raising client awareness in the corporate clients business

The Raiffeisen Group has around 220,000 corporate clients - mainly small and medium-sized enter- prises (SMEs). In total, 99.5% of Raiffeisen's corporate clients are domiciled in Switzerland (see "Client structure" table on ] page 74). Accordingly, they are regulated relatively efficiently and effectively in environmental, social and governance issues.

Nevertheless, Raiffeisen is also raising awareness of sustainability among its corporate clients in certain cases. For this purpose, a pilot project was carried out in 2023 with SwissEnergy's SME Platform for Energy Efficiency (PEIK), which advises SMEs on energy efficiency. In addition, the Go for Impact association received financial support in the year under review, so that it can press ahead with its activities to raise awareness among Swiss SMEs about climate benchmarking and target setting.


#### Sustainability in leasing

The Raiffeisen Group's leasing activities have been focussed primarily on corporate clients based in Switzerland, whom it has been serving for more than 30 years. The emphasis is on mobile capital goods and increasingly on "as new" items. Raiffeisen supports the active switch to alternative or technologically innovative solutions in several different industries.

In the current year under review, Raiffeisen supported the launch of a 100% electric commercial vehicle fleet for an active vendor partner as well as a number of other financing solutions for sustainable capital goods, such as a wide range of photovoltaic systems and energy-related investments.


##### Futura sustainable pension and investment solutions

In July of the year under review, a representative survey on sustainable investing originally conducted in 2021 was repeated with some of the respondents from that year. By way of comparison, the number of investors making sustainable investments has increased. There is still strong demand for additional and more detailed ESG information on the financial instruments used. Since the launch of the first Raiffeisen Futura fund in 2001, Raiffeisen has accordingly been consistently providing sus- tainable investment opportunities in pension and investment funds for its clients. Since 2019, all pillar 3 pension funds at Raiffeisen have been sustainable. The proportion of sustainable Futura funds in the total volume of all Raiffeisen funds has increased to 94.6%. In the year under review, the net inflow into Futura pension and investment funds amounted to more than CHF 1.1 billion. Including performance, the total volume increased by around 15.3% to CHF 13.9 billion in the year under review.

Sustainable Raiffeisen Futura funds account for 94.6% of the total volume.

<!-- PageNumber="66" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

The implementation of sustainability in the pension and investment business has been based on the "Sustainability Strategy for Investing & Retirement" since 2020. In line with the strategy, the relevant Raiffeisen collective investments comply with "Self-regulation on transparency and disclosure for sustainability-related collective assets, of 26 September 2022" published by the Asset Management Association Switzerland (AMAS). Work on implementing the Swiss Bankers Association's (SBA) "Guide- lines for the financial service providers on the integration of ESG-preferences and ESG-risks into investment advice and asset management" was completed in the year under review. As a result, all investment advisors received in-depth training in the fourth quarter on the topic of sustainable investing in general and the Futura Policy. This policy defines the approaches and criteria for all sustainable pension and investment solutions from Raiffeisen Switzerland. The training programme had been developed in house. The sustainability preferences of new clients have also been recorded since the year under review. Determining the sustainability preference of existing clients had been completed one year before the end of the transition period.

The Futura policy is explained in detail in the £ brochure "Sustainable Investing at Raiffeisen: the Futura Policy". At the core of the Futura policy is the principle that investment decisions are improved by using sustainability appraisals, incorporating both perspectives of "double materiality". The cor- responding sustainability review and assessment is carried out by the independent rating agency Inrate for direct investments, and by Vontobel Asset Management for collective investments. Another element of the Futura Policy is active ownership. This includes two elements: active use of the voting rights associated with the investments, and dialogue with companies ("investor dialogue" or "involve- ment"). Since 2009, all Raiffeisen Futura funds have made active use of voting rights for Swiss equities. This was extended in 2020 to include the use of voting rights for all shares in the Futura funds, i.e. also covering shares in international companies. For Swiss equities within the actively managed Futura funds, the voting rights are exercised by Ethos, Swiss Foundation for Sustainable Development. For all other stocks the funds follow the recommendations of Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).1 Since 2022, Ethos has also conducted investor dialogue (involvement) for Swiss and international companies selected by Raiffeisen Switzerland. Together with Ethos, Raiffeisen defines the issues on which the dialogue is to be conducted. The selected focus is currently on climate change, labour and human rights, and digital responsibility. Raiffeisen Switzerland also uses the opportunity to engage via Ethos with other institutional investors, in order to improve ESG aspects through collective involve- ment. Raiffeisen Switzerland made use of this option several times in the year under review. Support was provided for the following issues:

\- investor declaration concerning a meaningful EU law on artificial intelligence;

\- investor demand for urgent measures to reduce the use of plastics by intensive users of plastic packaging;

\- call for financial market participants to advocate greater independence and diversity for supervisory boards in Japanese companies;

\- call to the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to prioritise human capital and human rights;

\- climate Action Transition Plan Vote;

\- call to the relevant authorities in the various countries to commit to implementing International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 1 and 2 published by the ISSB throughout the economy by 2025, and

\- a living wage initiative in the US.

Raiffeisen Group Annual Report 2023


###### Active Ownership Report

In the interests of transparency, Raiffeisen Switzerland presented its first Active Ownership Report in the year under review. In addition to a description of the specific procedure, it also refers to the voting right principles. As early as 2022, sustainability reporting was added to a number of client reports. This takes into account direct investments (equities and bonds) and collective investments. In accordance with Article 17 of the SBA's "Guidelines for the financial service providers on the integration of ESG-preferences and ESG-risks into investment advice and asset management", Internal Auditing periodically reviews the appropriateness of the processes and effectiveness of the controls implemented at Raiffeisen Switzerland with regard to "sustainability in the investment business".

In the case of recommendations and model portfolios in the advisory business, Raiffeisen Switzerland only considers financial instruments that meet the defined ESG criteria in line with the Futura Policy. The Raiffeisen banks decide independently on the implementation of these recommendations.


####### Futura asset management mandates

As in the case of the pension and investment funds, ESG criteria have also been taken into account in the majority of Raiffeisen asset management mandates since 2022, in accordance with the Futura Policy. The Futura Impact asset management mandate was also introduced. Raiffeisen was thus the first national retail bank to make a solution of this type available to its clients. The volume of the Futura asset management mandates grew by 22.9 percentage points to CHF 8.9 billion in 2023.


######## Raiffeisen Sustainability and Green Bonds

In 2019, Raiffeisen Switzerland placed the very first sustainability bond on the Swiss capital market for investors. Raiffeisen Switzerland established a green bond programme in 2021. This focuses on the refinancing of mortgages granted to finance energy-efficient, low-emission buildings in Switzer- land. Due to the low financing needs of the Raiffeisen Group and the unfavourable market situation, Raiffeisen has not yet issued a similar bond. Raiffeisen acted as lead manager for various green bond issues from Swiss issuers.


######### Responsible and traceable gold

In 2021, a "Responsibly Sourced & Traceable" approach was adopted for all Raiffeisen gold ingots. This makes it possible to precisely trace the source of the gold and attaches importance to companies in the supply chain being environmentally and socially responsible. The gold processed into Raiffeisen gold ingots is sourced by the Argor-Heraeus refinery exclusively from certain mines, currently in North and South America, which meet the criteria defined by the refinery together with Raiffeisen. The mines and other supply chain partners can be identified by Raiffeisen clients on each ingot, using the ingot number. The refinery also uses gold from smaller mines in Colombia and, since 2022, also from Peru. These mines are part of the Swiss Better Gold Initiative, which is supported by Swiss Better Gold and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). Smaller gold producers and their envi- ronment are supported by the initiative through environmental and social projects and with regard to economic efficiency. Since the start of its collaboration with the Swiss Better Gold Initiative, Raiffeisen has generated more than USD 1.2 million for investments in appropriate projects through the sale of gold ingots.

Raiffeisen offers an asset management mandate which, besides financial goals, aims for a positive and measurable environ- mental and social impact.

<!-- PageHeader="Key figures" -->

Since 2021, investors have also had the opportunity to invest responsibly in the asset class gold through the "Raiffeisen ETF - Solid Gold Responsibly Sourced & Traceable". Raiffeisen was the first retail bank to implement a corresponding approach for a gold ETF. This has been recognised for the second time in a row with the Swiss ETF Award: the "Raiffeisen ETF - Solid Gold Responsibly Sourced & Traceable" won the Swiss ETF Award 2023 in the "Best Commodity and Precious Metal ETFs and ETPs" category in the year under review, after Raiffeisen was named "Newcomer of the Year" last year. The investment volume was CHF 583 million as at the end of 2023.

## 7 - Ensure long-term economic success

| | Raiffeisen generates added value for its clients, employees, investors and other partners as an independent and reliable partner | - Long-term financial ratings - ESG ratings :unselected: :unselected: | - Improved rating from Standard & Poor's (long term AA -; short term A-1+; outlook "stable") - MSCI improvement from BBB to A - All pension fund assets are screened for ESG factors :unselected: :unselected: :unselected: |

The cooperative Raiffeisen Group operates on the principle of targeting long-term, sustainable results and is not focused on maximising profit and growth at all cost. Raiffeisen thus strives to be a reliable, long-term partner for its stakeholders.

Cooperative members benefit from fair interest on their cooperative capital. Members can also benefit from particularly favourable conditions for certain banking transactions and from additional member advantages.

The Raiffeisen Group makes contributions to the public purse in the form of taxes throughout Switzer- land at the local, cantonal and federal levels. In contrast, Raiffeisen does not receive any public funds and does not benefit from government guarantees. Ultimately, continuous profit retention or self-financing through profits generated is important for long-term success.


### Distribution of added value

The Raiffeisen Group's cooperative business model results in economic performance being decen- tralised throughout Switzerland. This means that the Group can contribute to added value locally, regionally and nationally. It can do so not only through its core business of mortgage financing, but also through other financing and banking services, and through procurement, tax levies and its support for charitable organisations and initiatives.

The statement of net added value shows that the Raiffeisen Group's economic performance remained successful in the year under review. It can thus build on the previous years. Cooperative members, clients and society benefit from this.

The Raiffeisen Group contributes to added value locally, regionally and nationally, through its core business and through investments, taxes and sponsoring.

#### Good results for ratings

Raiffeisen's focus on the long term is also reflected in very good results in the relevant financial ratings. The rating agency Fitch confirmed its assessment of Raiffeisen in 2023 (long term A+; short term F1; outlook "stable"). The rating agency Standard & Poor's raised its rating in spring 2023 (long term AA -; short term A-1+; outlook "stable") in recognition of the early and complete fulfilment of regulatory Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements for systemically important banks.

Raiffeisen also achieved solid results in ESG ratings in the year under review. An A rating was achieved with MSCI ESG in 2023. Raiffeisen also retains its place in the Prime category of the International Shareholder Services (ISS) ESG rating, putting it in the top decile of the "public and regional banks" peer group.


##### Fair salary and pension fund benefits

Raiffeisen's more than 12,300 employees are paid fairly and in line with the market, and benefit from above-average social and pension benefits. The occupational pension funds are managed by an independent legal entity, the Raiffeisen Pension Fund Cooperative. It manages the pension assets of around 13,500 actively insured persons and pension recipients in a fiduciary capacity, taking sustain- able aspects into account. The technical parameters are defined in such a way as to prevent system-

atic redistribution between generations and to ensure long-term financial stability. Through the profit participation model, the pension fund allows its insured persons to participate in the investment success.

Sustainability is not only important for the stable financing of benefit assurances, free of any reallo- cation. The Raiffeisen Pension Fund is aware of its economic, environmental and social responsibility (ESG). In its role as an institutional investor, it manages pension assets carefully and considers ESG factors when selecting its investments. As part of the 2023 annual reporting, all pension fund assets were screened for ESG factors.

Unchecked greenhouse gas emissions increase global warming with serious consequences for human- ity and the environment. Raiffeisen aims to contribute towards climate change mitigation and supports the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement with the goal of net zero by 2050. Net zero means that greenhouse gas emissions are balanced out. This is achieved by reducing emissions as far as possible and removing the emissions that are difficult to avoid from the atmosphere, using natural or technical solutions. Raiffeisen sees itself as having a special responsibility in this respect, as the largest provider of mortgages in Switzerland. Greenhouse gas emissions also play a role in the sustainability assessment of pension and investment solutions.

Raiffeisen Switzerland has been ISO 14001-certified since 2022. ISO 14001 is a globally recognised standard for environmental management systems and covers all environmental aspects of companies. Application of the standard is aimed at minimising negative effects on the environment. The certifi- cation process was optionally extended to the Raiffeisen banks in the year under review. To date, 18 banks have obtained ISO 14001 certification.

In the year under review, Raiffeisen re-calculated its CO2 reduction targets using a more ambitious calculation method, a more up-to-date base year and an adjusted target horizon up to 2030. Raiffeisen Switzerland aims to achieve the net zero target by 2030 for operational and direct emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2). The Raiffeisen Group itself causes CO2 emissions by operating its 784 locations and due to business travel, transportation and the upstream and downstream processes.

By joining the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in 2023, Raiffeisen emphasised its shared responsibility for mitigating climate change (see also "Involve external stakeholders", 2] pages 56-58).

More detailed information as well as facts and figures are included in the separate note to the Annual Report 2023 entitled ] "Disclosure of climate information in accordance with the recommendations of the TCFD".

## 9 - Maintain open and fair interaction with clients

||||

In line with its mission statement, the Raiffeisen Group sets store by fairness, reliability and trans- parency in business relations with its clients. The focus is always on the satisfaction of the almost 3.69 million clients. Raiffeisen therefore maintains a competent, open and fair interaction with them. This includes the facts that Raiffeisen solutions are simple and straightforward, offer value for money and that prices are transparently communicated. This is the only way to ensure that clients can reach well informed decisions. Moreover, Raiffeisen is committed to the AA-plus quality label for e-banking introduced by the Access for All foundation as well as the European Transparency Code for sustain- ability funds.


### Transparency and fairness

The provision of financial services and the offering of financial instruments in Switzerland is regulated by the relevant laws and ordinances. Investor and function protection is at the heart of this. Raiffeisen implements all legal requirements in all its products and services. It thus promotes fairness and transparency as key aspects of investor protection in the provision of financial services and in the offering of financial instruments. Raiffeisen also implements self-regulation measures developed by Swiss associations. One of the aims of these self-regulation measures is also to protect investors. Foreign regulations are complied with where required.

Clients can contact their Raiffeisen bank if they have any concerns, grievances or complaints. In addition, they can refer to the neutral office of the Swiss Banking Ombudsman with any questions and concerns about banking and financial services.

A total of 97.7% of Raiffeisen's private clients are domiciled in Switzerland (see "Client structure" table, 2 page 74). Raiffeisen Switzerland recommends a specific target product portfolio for each client segment to the Raiffeisen banks. Any financial services and instruments not included in the portfolio will only be offered and provided to clients at their express request. Thanks to all these efforts, Raiffeisen has managed to provide a straightforward product range, combined with fair prices in line with the market and a high level of transparency. This promotes client focus, mutual trust and long-term client relationships.

With regard to fairness and transparency, various innovations were implemented in the year under review, e.g. sustainability reporting for Investing & Retirement, and simplification of pricing in invest- ment transactions. In addition, Raiffeisen provides its clients with a variety of information on the products offered (e.g. brochures, website, etc.).

#### High level of client satisfaction

Since 2020, Raiffeisen has conducted regular surveys among clients to check whether adequate fairness and transparency are ensured and are perceived as such by respondents. Specifically, this involves asking whether Raiffeisen deals fairly with clients and provides them with information that is transparent and clear, and whether Raiffeisen is perceived as a sustainable and responsible company. The results show that, once again in 2023, Raiffeisen is perceived as being a financial company that is better than average compared to the competition when it comes to sustainability and responsibility. This statement applies not only to our own clients, but to the Swiss population as a whole. In addition, Raiffeisen continues to achieve very good results in comparison with its competitors, holding a top position for general client satisfaction. The goal is to continue achieving a high level of satisfaction, and to maintain and enhance the positive perception in society.


### Increasing the financial knowledge of clients

For years, Raiffeisen has been committed to Money Mix as a way of improving young people's financial skills. And in cooperation with the learning platform evulpo, it has been supporting school children as they move towards financial independence. These two platforms and the learning content provided on them are free of charge and accessible by anyone. As a result, they can also be used by other social groups.

Raiffeisen also works with several financial education providers to increase the financial literacy of its clients. One example is the collaboration with Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), which conducts and publishes an annual external study on financial retirement provision on behalf of Raiffeisen. Another example is the bank's work with Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) on studies relating to digitalisation in the financial sector. Raiffeisen has integrated the topic of financial literacy into the advisory process for its client advisors. They convey this knowledge in meetings with their clients and in other ways.

<!-- PageNumber="74" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->


### Protection against debt accumulation by private individuals

Raiffeisen chiefly grants mortgage loans. To protect clients and prevent possible over-indebtedness, Raiffeisen calculates the long-term costs using an imputed interest rate when granting a mortgage loan. This also involves looking at the client's overall financial situation. To calculate affordability, housing costs are set in relation to income, with housing costs consisting of imputed interest expenses, repayments of principal, and expenses for maintaining the property. The loan will only be approved if the finance is affordable.


#### Protection of client data

Special mention must be made of client privacy when dealing with clients openly and fairly. Due to their business activity, banks hold particularly sensitive client data. Clients trust their bank to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements, handle their data responsibly and safeguard it as effec- tively as possible - whether against unauthorised access and changes, or against undesired deletion. Unwanted activities are detected by an automated reporting system, and stopped and analysed using established processes within statutory time limits and in compliance with requirements. The knowledge gained is input into continuous improvement of the defence system.

Since it has overall responsibility for the compliance system, Raiffeisen Switzerland is tasked with centrally protecting client data within the Raiffeisen Group and operates an information security management system (ISMS) based on the ISO/IEC 27001 standard. The purpose of the system is to ensure information integrity, availability and confidentiality at all times.

Cyber and information security is also constantly monitored and adapted to the current threat situation if necessary. Technical security solutions and systems are checked annually by Internal Auditing at Raiffeisen Switzerland in accordance with established auditing standards customary in the industry. Regular checks are additionally carried out by external bodies/authorities. Information security policies are also reviewed internally on an annual basis and, if necessary, adapted to reflect changing conditions.

With effect from 1 September 2023, the revised Data Protection Act and the implementation regu- lations in the revised Data Protection Ordinance came into force without a transitional period. Com- pliance with data protection is to be strengthened by requiring companies to fulfil certain obligations concerning organisation and documentation. Another focus is on strengthening transparency and the rights of data subjects.

To implement the revised Data Protection Act, Raiffeisen introduced new regulations effective 1 July 2023. In particular, these establish compliance with the principles of data protection law as a requirement. To raise awareness, new mandatory training courses on data protection and banking secrecy were introduced for all employees. These courses must be repeated every two years and were automatically assigned for the first time at the beginning of July 2023. The existing register of processing activities has been expanded to meet the requirements of the new Data Protection Act. The central register of processing activities is maintained by Raiffeisen Switzerland, and banks also keep a record of data processing activities under their own responsibility. To ensure compliance with the information obligations under the Data Protection Act, the existing data protection declarations for clients and interested parties as well as for users of Raiffeisen websites and apps were updated on the basis of the register of processing activities. New data protection declarations for employees and job applicants were also published. Contract data processing agreements (CDPAs) were concluded in the case of existing contractual relationships with contract data processors.

The existing process for reporting information security incidents was expanded to include the require- ment that the Data Protection unit must be involved in connection with personal data. In particular, the Data Protection unit checks any report made to the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC). There were no reportable incidents in the 2023 year under review. In addition, the following processes were adapted or newly introduced: conducting data protection impact assessments, the process for asserting data subjects' rights (requests for information, rectification, erasure, etc.) In addition, progress was made in data erasure measures.

</figure>


The Data Protection unit advises and monitors the Raiffeisen Group compliance with data protection legislation and banking secrecy. It also functions as Data Protection Officer and acts as the central point of contact. At the Raiffeisen banks, compliance officers perform these functions.

Rules on data protection and data security are implemented through internal directives and must be complied with not only by employees, but also by Raiffeisen suppliers and business partners. In addition, Raiffeisen conducts mandatory training sessions on awareness of information security every year and revises them on a regular basis. This training must be completed by all employees and by independent contractors who have access to Raiffeisen's IT systems.

The Raiffeisen Group constantly adapts its measures to protect client data in a continuous improve- ment process, depending on the current situation and challenges. Operations were optimised in the year under review, especially in the filter criteria, channel monitoring and in the data leakage pre- vention blocking (DLBP) of e-mails.


#### Improved regulations for information security

The "Information Security" (InfoSec) regulations were extensively revised in the year under review, as the protection of business data, especially client data, is of the utmost importance to Raiffeisen Switzerland and the Raiffeisen Group. The regulations are based on internationally recognised stan- dards (ISO/IEC) in order to guarantee a level that is customary in the industry. To take account of changes in the threat situation and define appropriate protective measures, all directives are reviewed each year and adapted if necessary. In 2023, for example, foreign access to client data was regulated more precisely to continue ensuring adequate protection.

Audits on various aspects of cyber/information security are carried out several times a year by both internal and external auditors. Raiffeisen Switzerland is guided by regulatory requirements and com- plies with them.


##### Fair sales activities

Fair sales in the sense of sustainable sales are to be viewed as a strategy of comprehensively focusing on the use of resources in sales activities, involving employees, processes, products, services and clients. Raiffeisen is fully aligned with this strategy and uses this understanding to increase long-term success for all stakeholders. Client relationships are viewed as partnerships, characterised by appre- ciation, fairness and reliability. This enables the Raiffeisen Group to create a win-win situation for all parties involved, resulting in long-term client relationships.

Fairness in Raiffeisen's offering is not only reflected in the consistent application of the Price Indication Ordinance, but also goes beyond this by providing transparent and appropriate communication with clients. All product, price and marketing information is available to existing clients and prospective new clients on the Raiffeisen website under "Interest rates and prices".

The Raiffeisen membership programme is a basic product offering that is one of the fairest on the market in terms of value for money. It lays the foundation for a long-term client relationship. The services offered by Raiffeisen in the investment business, from investment advice to asset manage- ment, are geared towards the needs of clients. The duty to inform clients is fully guaranteed under the Financial Services Act (FinSA). Transactions involving financial instruments are always associated with opportunities and risks. This makes it necessary for clients to understand the risks before using a financial service. For this purpose, the brochure "Risks Involved in Trading Financial Instruments" is available on the website at ] raiffeisen.ch/risikobroschuere. This brochure provides clients with relevant information on the risks involved in trading financial instruments, among other information.

The scope of investor protection depends on the client segmentation and the type of financial service used by the client. Raiffeisen has also defined uniform Group-wide standards aimed at avoiding conflicts of interest.

<!-- PageNumber="76" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

Fairness in establishing and developing the client relationship is also expressed in Raiffeisen's basic regulations. These summarise the general terms and conditions for clients in a concise, clear and easy-to-understand way, with the aim of being able to process the agreement rapidly with compre- hensible conditions. Small font sizes, long texts and complicated wording are not used, providing clients with a compact set of agreements that still meets all legal standards.

Sustainability in sales activities also includes the quality and long-term nature of a client relationship. If a loan or other service is rejected, clients are informed of the reasons in a detailed and easy-to-un- derstand way. The reasons are then stored in the client data as standard. Fair rules of conduct are also assured when services and transactions are refused.

Metrics on client privacy and marketing

The survey data on client satisfaction, the client complaint process and the number of breaches of the relevant provisions may point to any deficiencies in the processes. Specific metrics are used for this purpose (see table below). They currently show no acute need for action in the area of fairness and transparency in client relations.

| Marketing and labelling and protecting client data1 |||||
| | GRI indicator | 202 | 2022 | 2023 |
| - | - | - | - | - |

1 In this context, a zero means that no serious cases are known as at the end of the year under review.

2 One serious incident was registered by the internal DLP system in the year under review. It was possible to limit the data loss by taking prompt action. Raiffeisen has reported this incident to FINMA. As a result, it is also listed as a complaint from outside parties and regulatory bodies.

3 DLP alarms are triggered in response to rules based on a scoring system and serve as an indication of potential breaches of regulations. An alarm does not automatically mean that a regulation has been violated.

## Employees

Raiffeisen reflects the cultural diversity in Switzerland: with more than 780 locations in all language regions of Switzerland, Raiffeisen has deep roots and is positioned close to its clients. Diversity is also lived by our employees. The corporate culture of Raiffeisen is based on appreciation and mutual respect. Raiffeisen offers its over 12,000 employees and more than 700 people in a training programme for young talents attractive employment conditions and interesting training and development opportunities.

<!-- PageNumber="79" -->

Raiffeisen Group Annual Report 2023


### Attractive employer

In addition to clients, employees also play a key role at Raiffeisen. As a major employer in Switzerland, it offers its 12,328 employees (previous year:1 11,878) attractive working conditions: a modern work- ing environment, flexible work models and a culture that promotes diversity and innovation. It attaches great importance to all employees having the same opportunities to realise their potential and develop their careers according to specific needs. The banking group invests in the continuing education of its employees, in developing its own talent and attracting new talent. Values including solidarity, sustainability, corporate involvement and maintaining a respectful dialogue with staff are important to Raiffeisen as a cooperative bank.

The fact that Raiffeisen is a popular employer is confirmed by the Universum ranking produced by Universum Communications Switzerland AG, an employer branding specialist. In 2023, Raiffeisen took 36th place (previous year: 23rd place) among the most attractive employers in Switzerland. The companies assessed in the current survey obtained scores that were close to each other. As a result, a small change in the number of points obtained equates to a relatively large shift in the ranking. Raiffeisen believes it is on track to achieve its ambitious goal of ranking among the top 20 employers by 2025. On Europe's largest independent employer rating portal, the Raiffeisen Group received the "Kununu Top Company" award with an average score of 4.0 out of a possible 5 points. This is signif- icantly above the average score for banks (3.7 points). The appreciative culture at Raiffeisen is sup- ported by current employees and given visibility by a modern employer image.


### Corporate culture and diversity

Diverse teams and an inclusive corporate culture have been shown to have a positive impact on economic success and employee satisfaction. It is therefore important to Raiffeisen to encourage and promote diversity, equal opportunities and an inclusive culture.

Raiffeisen is committed to equal opportunities in practice. It promotes all employees equally, regardless of gender, gender identity, age, ethnic origin, nationality, sexual orientation, religion, social back- ground or physical abilities. This also means that Raiffeisen has zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind, harassment or abusive conduct.

These principles are reflected in all HR processes and are set out in the "Raiffeisen stance on diversity" and in Raiffeisen Switzerland's employment policy entitled "Equal treatment and harassment at work". The internal Balanced Organisation initiative, which aims to develop the diverse and inclusive corporate culture and promote equal opportunities within the Raiffeisen Group, is included in the Human Resources strategy. Employee diversity is regularly discussed by the Executive Board and Board of Directors and has been implemented via a set of specific targets. Since 2022, Raiffeisen Group managers have had the opportunity to take part in a workshop exploring the topic "Diversity and equal opportunities as factors in success" in greater depth, and to learn from each other through dialogue.

Raiffeisen promotes all employees equally.

<!-- PageHeader="Management report Corporate governance" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Annual financial statements" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

The staff networks promoting diversity were continued in the year under review. These communities are open to all Raiffeisen Group employees and managers. They offer the opportunity to network across the Group, make diversity visible at Raiffeisen and raise awareness among employees:


## \- Raiffeisen Unique

Unique is committed to gender balance and targeted support for women. The network raises their profile. The members of Unique are also committed to equality, regardless of gender and gender identity.


### \- Languages and Culture

The Languages and Culture community is involved in the promotion and visibility of linguistic and cultural diversity. Linguistic and regional borders are overcome with the aim of promoting cultural diversity and putting it into practice.


## \- Queer community

The Queer community promotes the visibility of issues specific to LGBTQ+ individuals and raises awareness about these issues. Promoting an open, respectful and inclusive corporate culture is at the core of their commitment. In the year under review, the Queer community was represented at Pride in Zurich for the first time and undertook various company-internal initiatives during Pride Month.

Fostering employees' skills and diversity is one of the 10 focus topics in Raiffeisen's Group-wide sustainability strategy. See also the chapter "Sustainability", E pages 51-78.


### Targeted promotion of gender diversity

Increasing the percentage of women in senior and management positions is a priority at Raiffeisen. The goal is to raise the proportion of women in senior positions across the Group to at least 31% by 2025. The Group has not quite hit this target yet. As at 31 December 2023, women held 30.4% of senior and management positions (previous year: 29.2%).

Ensuring equality between genders is a matter of importance for Raiffeisen.

Raiffeisen Switzerland launched a mentoring programme in 2021 with a focus on promoting top performers. Around 50 members of management in the Raiffeisen Group have taken part since it was introduced. The programme was initially only aimed at women, but was also opened up to men in the 2023 year under review due to its great success. The mentees are supported by experienced mentors for a year and take part in various workshops and networking events. They have the chance to develop their individual professional, leadership and social skills, to strengthen themselves in their role, or to focus on the next step in their career. The programme is also a good opportunity to network within the Raiffeisen Group.

As a member of the Advance Gender Equality in Business initiative, Raiffeisen is networked throughout Switzerland and across industries, thus contributing to the dialogue between business organisations, academics and policymakers. Through this partnership, Raiffeisen offers its employees the opportunity to exchange views across sectors, even outside the Group. It also regularly takes part in St. Gallen diversity benchmarking at the University of St. Gallen. By doing so, Raiffeisen contributes to trans- parency with regard to the development of diversity in the industry.

The following tables show the current staff structure by management level and employment rela- tionship within the Raiffeisen Group. Raiffeisen changed the calculation methods in the year under review and harmonised them with the financial scope of consolidation. All employees of the com- panies included in the scope of consolidation of the Raiffeisen Group (see chapter ] "Corporate governance", page 114) are now included in this detailed social report. For these reasons, there may be discrepancies in the staffing figures compared to those published in the 2022 Annual Report.

## Equal pay respected

Raiffeisen Switzerland attaches great importance to equality between men and women. This must also be reflected in equal pay. Analyses of staff pay conducted at regular intervals ensure that equal pay is implemented at the operational level and that the requirements of the Gender Equality Act are met. In 2021, Raiffeisen Switzerland and all Raiffeisen banks with more than 100 employees carried out the legally required analysis of equal pay between women and men within the company in the context of the overhaul of the Gender Equality Act (GlG) of 1 July 2020. Raiffeisen was awarded the Fair-ON-Pay certificate based on the result. This confirms that Raiffeisen upholds equal pay. The analysis must be carried out every two years to maintain the certificate. Comp-On AG analysed equal pay in the 2023 year under review. SGS, a global certification company with extensive experience in the area of pay equality, formally reviewed the analysis. The results confirm the certification. Raiffeisen Switzerland is also on the "white list" of Respect 8-3, a project run by the Travail Suisse trade union to uphold equal pay, due to its efforts to promote equality in this regard.

Raiffeisen complies with equal pay and holds the SGS Fair ON Pay certificate.

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->


### Agility and transformation

Lean management and agile working methods are becoming increasingly important in day-to-day work and support Raiffeisen in optimising processes. Raiffeisen Switzerland has successfully applied scaled agility in 2022 for the first time, in conjunction with the project group developing the new Raiffeisen app. Since then, other workgroups and project teams have been receiving support for introducing agile working methods on request. Lean management is now part of the product range from which the entire Group can benefit. Employees also volunteer in agile communities and share ideas about agile working methods, for example in the Product Owner Chapter, in the Scrum Master Community or in the expert group of agile coaches. Raiffeisen continued to drive forward its digital- isation projects in the year under review as part of process optimisation: the ePersonnel dossier was successfully introduced and the HR core system was improved. The entire Raiffeisen Group will benefit from this.

A specific product is available for Raiffeisen banks: Raiffeisen Banks TRAIL. This will enable them to structure their approach to their particular change processes relating to culture, cooperation and innovation. Raiffeisen Switzerland supports these processes as required.

In order to reinforce the organisation's ability to change, Raiffeisen Switzerland launched its "Ongoing Leadership Dialogue" programme in the year under review. This enables the most senior managers to take a regular look at current and future requirements with regard to leadership and the ability to change, and to develop their skills in this area. The programme thus makes a valuable contribution to the future viability of the organisation and is to be extended to all managers in subsequent years.


### Measuring employee satisfaction

Ensuring employee satisfaction and promoting a positive corporate culture are key issues for Raiffeisen. For this reason, Raiffeisen Switzerland engages an external firm of consultants to conduct an employee survey each year, alternating between a full survey and a pulse measurement. Both types of survey measure employee satisfaction and organisational energy (energy index). The full measurement is a more comprehensive survey than the pulse measurement. The questions also consider aspects of culture, general conditions or workload, attractiveness and identification with Raiffeisen Switzerland. The survey is distributed to both permanent and temporary employees (with contracts exceeding three months) of Raiffeisen Switzerland. A full measurement was carried out in the year under review, in which employees answered a total of around 70 questions. The response rate was very good at 84%. A further increase in the energy index was also found, compared to the last survey. Based on detailed analysis of the feedback, specific measures are developed in workshops (in the departments, but also in the Executive Board) in order to work on the defined approaches and further increase employee satisfaction. Overall measures were defined for Raiffeisen Switzerland using the following three approaches:

1\. Strengthening decision-making authority and the acceptance of responsibility, with the aim of reducing the hierarchy when working together.

2\. Promoting health to strengthen individual resources and resilience, and to identify stressful situations and mental health problems at an early stage. New offerings relating to "Healthy Living & Working" are to be launched.

3\. Promoting lean-agile methods and forms of working in order to operate increasingly in autonomous teams, prioritise comprehensively and make plans jointly.

The Raiffeisen banks have the option to conduct their own staff survey with the same external partner, and to review the results and further steps in cooperation with Raiffeisen Switzerland.

## Modern employment conditions

Thanks to modern working conditions, Raiffeisen has succeeded in creating an attractive working environment and building long-term relationships with its employees. These relationships are a core driver of the company's success. The table "Other key staffing figures" shows that Raiffeisen employ- ees have been with Raiffeisen for more than 11 years on average. This is a very good figure by industry standards. Another indicator that supports Raiffeisen's attractiveness as an employer is the retention rate after maternity leave: around 70% of expectant mothers are still employed by Raiffeisen after 12 months (see table ] "Family policy metrics", page 87).

### Dialogue and participation

Raiffeisen Switzerland is subject to the Agreement on Conditions of Employment for Bank Employees (ACE), which was developed and published by the Employers' Association of Swiss Banks, the Swiss Bank Employees Association and the Swiss Association of Commercial Employees. ACE governs the provisions of employment contracts and the participation of employees. Raiffeisen Switzerland's seven-member employee committee acts as a link between the employer and employees. It is com- mitted to a fair, transparent and professional employment relationship and actively maintains relations with social partners (in particular the Swiss Bank Employees Association (SBEA). Employee partici- pation in the employee committee of Raiffeisen Switzerland is governed in the relevant employment policy.

Although Raiffeisen banks are not subject to ACE, its provisions are taken into account by the Raiffeisen banks in their contract of employment. Raiffeisen recognises the fundamental rights applicable within Switzerland, including freedom of association, freedom of assembly and the right to organise for employees to protect their own interests. Consequently, these rights can also be exercised by Raiffeisen employees.


#### Flexible working and holiday models

Raiffeisen encourages employees to think and act with an entrepreneurial mindset by specifically delegating responsibility and giving them considerable freedom to make their ideas a reality. This includes flexible work hours, which are provided across all levels of the hierarchy wherever possible. Raiffeisen Switzerland also has FlexWork, which allows staff to spend up to 80% of their time working from a place of their choice, in consultation with their line manager and if compatible with the activity. This approach accommodates employees' individual needs and improves their work-life balance. The Raiffeisen banks are at liberty to use the working time model as well.

Depending on their age and seniority, employees have 25 to 30 days of holiday per year. This places Raiffeisen above the Swiss average. In addition, long-service anniversaries are rewarded with additional holiday days. Since 2018 employees have also been able to buy additional days of holiday or save up days for extended individual breaks.

Flexible working hours allow employees to balance their job, family and leisure time very well.

<!-- PageHeader="Key figures" -->


### Family policy

Raiffeisen Switzerland provides modern-day benefits for families. Mothers at Raiffeisen receive 16 to 24 weeks of maternity leave, depending on their length of service. Fathers are entitled to three weeks of paternity leave upon the birth of their children or upon adoption, which they can take up to one month before and up to six months after their child is born or adopted. Women are guaranteed continued employment at a level of at least 60% in an appropriate function after their maternity leave. Parents have up to five paid days of absence to care for sick children per each occurrence of sickness. These rules apply to all permanent employees of Raiffeisen Switzerland, including same-sex couples.

## Remuneration model and ongoing performance dialogue at Raiffeisen Switzerland

The remuneration model introduced for Raiffeisen Switzerland as of 2021 includes a collective profit-sharing element instead of individual bonus payments. The emphasis is therefore on collective performance. This remuneration model also applies to the members of the Executive Board of Raiffeisen Switzerland.

In addition to remuneration in line with the market, Raiffeisen Switzerland offers its employees numerous additional non-monetary benefits, such as the Member Plus programme and the purchase of Reka credit at a reduced price. These benefits are available to all employees (including part-time employees or employees in a fixed-term position).

In addition to individual performance, team performance is particularly valued and rewarded at Raiffeisen. The "Recognition of outstanding team performance" programme enables Raiffeisen Switzer- land employees to highlight and reward outstanding performance and contributions to the Raiffeisen culture by intra- and interdisciplinary teams (organisational units, project teams, working groups, etc.), both top-down and bottom-up within the organisation. To highlight special team achievements and the associated successes, the Team Players award was once again presented by employees to employees in the year under review. The award in the form of team events is aimed at showing very special appreciation for outstanding team performance and excellent collaboration.

Performance appraisals and feedback sessions are held twice a year at Raiffeisen Switzerland as part of the ongoing performance dialogue (OPD) for all employees and managers. Employees' individual development planning is discussed and appropriate development measures are defined jointly. To maximise objectivity in the performance appraisal, the assessments in the dimensions "culture" and "performance" are calibrated in management teams (review circles). The overall OPD process also includes pulse checks, 360-degree feedback, peer and manager feedback. The autonomous Raiffeisen banks are at liberty to decide how they assess the performance and professional development of their employees.

For more details on the remuneration model, see the chapter "Remuneration report", 2] pages 136-144.

## Occupational health management

Raiffeisen Switzerland's "Healthy Living & Working" programme aims to promote a sustainable style of living and working. Raising awareness, prevention and personal responsibility have high priority in this respect. Various workshops and webinars are available to Raiffeisen Switzerland employees in all language regions on topics such as resilience and healthy leadership, mental and physical health, exercise and nutrition. Raiffeisen Switzerland employees also have access to other health-promoting offers such as outlets with healthy food options, discounts on fitness subscriptions and free health checks. The Raiffeisen banks can introduce and implement their own health programmes tailored to their specific needs on a voluntary basis.

In addition to the counselling services provided by Human Resources, all Group employees have had access to an assistance programme through external and independent partner RehaSuisse for several years now. This provides a wide range of support options in the form of coaching and counselling. This programme offers anonymous help for employees experiencing difficult situations in their pro- fessional or private lives, as well as health issues. Due to its clear processes, psychological expertise and extensive experience in the social insurance sector, RehaSuisse makes a valuable contribution to responding appropriately to the challenges arising from exceptional situations involving Raiffeisen employees.

Raiffeisen also has an external whistleblowing office. More on this in the chapter "Sustainability" under section 2 - "Strengthen governance", 2] pages 55-56.


## Investing in employee development

Raiffeisen fosters lifelong learning among its employees. Thus, managers and non-managerial employ- ees can tap into a broad range of technical and leadership training courses, certification as an advisor as well as personal development opportunities. The training offers are adapted to the needs of the various target groups and can be used by all permanent employees (including part-time employees). If required, external employees of Raiffeisen Switzerland, temporary workers and trainees or interns also have access to function-specific further education offers. There are specific programmes for junior staff, members of the Executive Board and Board of Directors, client advisors and specialists, which make the training more job-specific.


### Continuing education programme for specialists and managers

While the continuing education programmes for executives serve to develop leadership skills, they also facilitate targeted succession planning. The various seminars last between 5 and 18 days and are aimed at both new and experienced managers. Skills in communication, conflict, presentation, cooperation and strategy are taught and applied in a practical way. Employees can also enrol in various programmes developed specifically for Raiffeisen in cooperation with Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. The continuing education offering includes seminars for those preparing for retirement. These courses deal with issues such as prospects, health, a network of relationships and pensions.

In 2023 Raiffeisen invested a total of CHF 20.4 million (previous year: CHF 17.9 million) in the con- tinuing education of employees.

The continuing education programme is aimed at all employees, regardless of their role.

</figure>


Internal training programmes and learning formats are designed based on specific goals, assessed by attendees and continuously improved. Strategic training requirements for each professional cat- egory are determined in close consultation with the relevant work environment and the responsible specialist areas. Raiffeisen Switzerland also continued to drive forward its internal talent management programme in the year under review. This aims to systematically identify employees with potential, develop them further, prepare them for future challenges and strengthen their loyalty to the company. These internal measures serve to counter the risk of a shortage of skilled workers and open up attractive development opportunities for talented individuals.

Even after the pandemic, Raiffeisen has maintained the hybrid model of internal training and devel- opment events, firmly establishing the option of either physical or online courses within the organ- isation. The flexible learning formats make it possible to react quickly to changes and to include current issues promptly in the continuing education programme. In addition, training formats that can be used anywhere at any time also cut down on travel and time spent away from everyday work.

In the year under review, Raiffeisen employees took part in a total of 12,587 participant days of inter- nal training and development. A total of 863 courses were conducted. In addition, 229 employees received an advisor certification. The following overview shows the details of the training and devel- opment courses:

Training young talent

Young people are another key factor in Raiffeisen's future success. Raiffeisen's focused training programmes for young people are an expression of its social responsibility for large numbers of young people throughout Switzerland. At the end of 2023, there was a total of 773 people (previous year: 790) on a training programme for young talent. Some 41.8% of them (previous year: 42.9%) were female.

Investing in training young people pays off: many of those trained at Raiffeisen stay with the company after completing their apprenticeship, internship or trainee programme and take the opportunity to continue developing at Raiffeisen.

Raiffeisen offers a number of training placements for young people with different educational back- grounds. It was also involved in the 2023 reform of commercial apprenticeships throughout Switzer- land. In 2023, 281 new career starters began their apprenticeship or internship at Raiffeisen in one of the following job profiles:

Apprenticeships:

\- Federal VET diploma in business administration (banking; service and administration)

Raiffeisen Switzerland once again took part in National Future Day in the year under review to give the employees of tomorrow an insight into the world of work. Employees' children were given an insight into the various professions at Raiffeisen Switzerland in a kind of careers fair and were allowed to accompany their carer to their workplace for half a day. Various presentations and interactions rounded off the programme.

Raiffeisen is training junior staff in various professions.

Based on risk and materiality considerations we have undertaken procedures to obtain sufficient evidence. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatements in the above mentioned information. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in scope than, for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement.

Although we considered the effectiveness of management's internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.

The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) quantification process is subject to scientific uncertainty, which arises because of incomplete scientific knowledge about the measurement of GHGs. Additionally, GHG procedures are subject to estimation (or measurement) uncertainty resulting from the measurement and calculation processes used to quantify emissions within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge.

Our limited assurance procedures included, amongst others, the following work:

► Assessment of the suitability of the underlying criteria and their consistent application

\> Interviews with relevant personnel to understand the business and reporting process, including the sustainability strategy, principles and management > Interviews with the Group's key personnel to understand the sustainability reporting system during the reporting period, including the process for collecting, collating and reporting the information

► Checking that the calculation criteria have been correctly applied in accordance with the methodologies outlined in the applicable criteria

► Analytical review procedures to support the reasonableness of the data

\> Identifying and testing assumptions supporting calculations

\> Testing, on a sample basis, underlying source information to check the accuracy of the data

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion.

## Risk report

Raiffeisen is exposed to a number of risks resulting from its operating activities. Being part of the financial system, Raiffeisen is also exposed to global risks. The framework for risk management provides details of the vari- eties, types and levels of risks. It also deals with the Group-wide risk management tools.

<!-- PageNumber="94" -->


## Risks and principles

Overall responsibility for risk management and risk control at the Raiffeisen Group lies with the Raiffeisen Switzerland Board of Directors. They approve the framework for Group-wide risk manage- ment, set the risk policy and determine the risk tolerance of the Raiffeisen Group every year.


## Risk policy principles

The Raiffeisen Group takes a cautious and selective approach to risk within a framework of clearly defined guidelines. It actively controls the risks it takes and takes care to strike the correct balance between risk and return. It acts based on stable guidelines:

\- Clear business and risk policies: Risk taking is directly linked to the core business in Switzerland.

\- Effective risk limitation: The Raiffeisen Group's risk tolerance is clearly defined and enforced with a tried-and-tested limit system.

\- Central monitoring: Raiffeisen Switzerland monitors its individual business units, subsidiaries and participations.

\- Decentralised individual responsibility in line with clearly defined guidelines: The Raiffeisen banks are responsible for managing their risks themselves. Raiffeisen Switzerland lays down binding guidelines relating to business activities, limits and processes. The central controlling units monitor compliance with the guidelines.

\- Risk control based on transparency: Independent reports are regularly issued on the risk situation as well as on the risk profile of the individual Raiffeisen banks and the Raiffeisen Group.

\- Independent risk monitoring and effective controls: Overall risk and limits are monitored independently of the risk-managing business units. Effective risk control ensures that the predefined processes and thresholds are adhered to.

\- Comprehensive risk management process: The Raiffeisen Group's risk management is a uniform and binding process comprising identification, measurement, assessment, management, monitoring and reporting.

\- Avoidance of risk concentration: The Raiffeisen Group has effective tools at its disposal for identifying unwanted risk concentration and taking proactive measures to avoid it.

\- Reputation protection: The Raiffeisen Group attaches great importance to protecting its reputation. Environmental, social and governance factors are taken appropriately into account in its business activities, with the aim of ensuring responsible business conduct.

An overview of the risks, the risk assessment, risk control and risk profile control can be found in the publication "Regulatory disclosure", 2] pages 7-10, and in the notes to the consolidated annual financial statements, 2] from page 153.

Raiffeisen takes a cautious approach to risk and takes care to strike the correct balance between risk and return.

## Risk categories


### Strategic risks

Strategic risks refer to the risk that events within or around the Bank could hinder the achievement of strategic objectives or make them impossible. They are closely related to the Bank's strategic direction, business model and risk profile. Strategic risks may be caused by factors such as unrealistic price and profitability assumptions, misjudgement of market trends and competitors, ineffective acquisitions, and failure to adapt. The damage associated with these risks could be considerable and, in a worst-case scenario, could jeopardise the institution's very existence. As a rule, strategic risks can only be controlled indirectly by using identification as a basis for developing appropriate measures such that, if the event occurs, the negative impact on the institution is minimised.

Each year, the Risk & Compliance department at Raiffeisen Switzerland develops an overview of the strategic risks to which the Raiffeisen Group is exposed. This involves identifying and assessing potential threats, on the basis of which the top risks for Raiffeisen are analysed. The qualitative aspects of Raiffeisen Group's risk exposure are then evaluated and presented to the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland for discussion.


## Reputational risks

Reputational risks refer to the risk arising from damage to the Raiffeisen Group's reputation among the relevant stakeholders and the general public.

Raiffeisen views reputational risks as a possible consequence of any of the risk categories, so risk management takes all of these categories into account. Raiffeisen Switzerland uses suitable tools to ensure that reputational risks are monitored.


## Credit risks

Credit risk management at the Raiffeisen Group is geared specifically to Raiffeisen-specific client and business structures. The Raiffeisen banks' client knowledge and decentralised individual responsibility play a key role in lending decisions and credit management. This is also true in cases where loans require the approval of Raiffeisen Switzerland because of their size or complexity.

Credit risks are reviewed and assessed in nominal and risk-weighted terms. Management decisions are also based on statistical loss metrics (i.e. value-at-risk) and scenario analyses. Risks are also monitored using credit quality metrics. Examples include financial viability, loan-to-value ratios, ratings and rating changes, as well as portfolio characteristics such as diversification across borrowers, industries and collateral types.

Due to the Raiffeisen Group's strong market position in lending, credit risk is the most important risk category. The Raiffeisen Group generates a large part of its income by taking on credit risks and managing them comprehensively and systematically.

Due to its strong market position in the lending business, credit risks are the main risk category for Raiffeisen.

1 The data in the chart on the right has been magnified 50 times compared to the chart on the left.

Raiffeisen's main credit risks arise from transactions involving loans secured by mortgages to private clients. Credit risks also result from lending to corporate clients and public-sector entities and from interbank business. Raiffeisen Switzerland monitors, controls and manages risk concentrations within the Raiffeisen Group, especially for groups of affiliated counterparties and for sectors.

Lending within the Raiffeisen Group is governed by a prudent credit policy and professional credit checking.

Raiffeisen predominantly grants mortgage-secured loans. This is why loan-to-value ratios play a crucial role in lending besides financial viability and amortisation of mortgage loans. When assessing collat- eral, a distinction is made between three lending groups:

\- Lending group 1 includes mortgage-secured loans on residential and agricultural properties with a loan-to-value ratio of up to two-thirds of the market value as well as building land, office and commercial buildings and multifunctional commercial properties that are mortgaged up to half of the market value. This group also includes large commercial and industrial properties with a loan-to-value ratio of up to one-third of the market value.

\- Lending group 2 includes the percentage of mortgage-secured loans that exceed the afore- mentioned limits, large commercial and industrial properties with a loan-to-market value ratio of 50%, and other properties with mortgages representing up to 80% of the market value.

\- Lending group 3 contains loans that exceed the loan-to-value limits of lending group 2. This also includes any loans covered by additional collateral, provided the value of the mortgage is less than the book value of the mortgage loan amount.

Raiffeisen mainly provides secured loans based on the client's financial viability.

In its corporate clients business, the Raiffeisen Group generally only offers financing to companies with good to medium credit ratings. The risk tolerance in the corporate lending business is defined and implemented with corresponding limits for the entire Group. The Raiffeisen Group's priority is to place the expansion of its corporate clients business on a solid foundation and in accordance with the dedicated corporate clients strategy.

Raiffeisen is continuously expanding its corporate clients business in line with its corporate clients strategy.

The largest share of loans to corporate clients goes to companies in the real estate sector. Most of these loans are secured by mortgages. The loans in the other sectors are broadly diversified.

Active country risk management

Raiffeisen Switzerland's commitments abroad are limited to 5% of the Raiffeisen Group's total assets. Raiffeisen banks may not provide any banking or financial services abroad. At Raiffeisen Switzerland, the Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department, including Raiffeisen Switzerland B.V. Amster- dam, can enter into commitments abroad. These commitments are limited in amount and monitored on an ongoing basis. The highest country limits are for countries with very good ratings.

Credit portfolio analysis and assessment

The Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland is periodically apprised of the assessment of the quality of the Raiffeisen Group's credit portfolio. Analyses focus on information about changes in the risk situation, structural and qualitative features of the credit portfolio, compliance with limits and specifications, and measures taken. Furthermore, the impacts of extreme macroeconomic changes on the credit portfolio are monitored.

Measuring credit risks Credit risks are quantified using the following parameters:

\- probability of default (PD);

\- credit exposure at the time of default (EAD);

\- value of the collateral - loss given default (LGD).

The core instrument for counterparty credit risk measurement is the rating system, which is maintained and monitored by Raiffeisen Switzerland's Risk & Compliance department. The Raiffeisen Group has implemented comprehensive rating system governance in connection with the internal rating system. Rating system governance aims to organise internal rating system processes and responsibilities within the Group in a way that will consistently ensure the quality and effectiveness of the rating models and their application. To avoid loopholes and conflicts of interest, tasks, powers and responsibilities were defined for stakeholders, while key positions and corresponding key controls were implemented.

Raiffeisen employs the Foundation Internal Rating Based (F-IRB) model approach approved by FINMA. Raiffeisen uses a value-at-risk method to measure credit portfolio risks for internal purposes.

Raiffeisen Switzerland's commitments abroad are limited to 5% of the consolidated total assets.

The rating system is the core instrument for measuring counterparty credit risks.

### Assessment of the risk situation with respect to credit risks

The current risk situation is dominated by the uncertain economic and geopolitical situation globally, and the general rise in interest rates. Business bankruptcies in Switzerland are continuing to rise. Despite the significant rise in interest rates, the Swiss real estate market remains largely robust. The Raiffeisen Group's credit portfolio does not indicate any material irregularities relating to credit defaults or any associated increased need for value adjustment.

The credit portfolio is performing within the scope specified by the credit policy in line with the business strategy of qualitative growth.

The credit portfolio is characterised by low risk intensity overall. Lending is generally conservative and collateralised, i.e. against the deposit of collateral. In addition, borrowers must also be able to afford the financial burden.

Some 88% of the Raiffeisen Group's credit portfolio is covered by mortgages. Around half of the credit portfolio is secured by owner-occupied residential properties, while real estate used by third parties accounts for around 31%.

Raiffeisen follows the performance of the Swiss real estate market closely and monitors its credit portfolio extensively.

The individual client segments of the Raiffeisen Group's credit portfolio have been stable for years. Over 70% of the credit volume comes from the private client segment. In the corporate clients business, Raiffeisen attaches importance to sufficient diversification and focuses on companies in sectors with long-term growth potential. Raiffeisen is cautious about lending to firms in unattractive industries.

Risk intensity is low overall due to the broad diversification of the credit portfolio and the long-term, conservative credit policy.

Regular stress tests show that the Raiffeisen Group's credit portfolio is robust and well diversified, even under sharply deteriorating conditions.


## Market risks


### Risks in the banking book

The banking book is primarily exposed to interest rate risks and foreign currency risks. Risks associated with fluctuating interest rates arise due to the Raiffeisen Group's significant positioning in interest operations and represent a major risk category. They are actively managed and monitored within authorised risk limits.

Clear guidelines and limits apply to the management of interest rate risks within the Raiffeisen Group - both for the Group as a whole and for individual legal entities. Within these guidelines management is carried out autonomously by the individual legal entities, i.e. the Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland. The managers responsible have a proven toolkit, including the ability to simulate interest rate changes and assess their impact. The Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department provides advice on asset and liability management within the Raiffeisen Group. None of the other Group companies assumes any material risks associated with fluctuating interest rates.

The Risk & Compliance department monitors compliance with interest rate risk limits and the overall development of interest rate risks. It focuses on monitoring the interest rate sensitivity of equity capital and running simulations to analyse the impact of changes in market interest rates on interest income. Interest-driven value-at-risk is also calculated in order to monitor the overall risk situation at various levels within the Group.

The credit portfolio is characterised by low risk intensity overall.

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

The publication "Regulatory disclosure" contains further details on interest rate risk management and interest rate risk exposure in accordance with the FINMA Circular 2016/1 "Disclosure - banks".

With respect to foreign currency risks, assets in a foreign currency are mostly refinanced in the same currency ("matched book" approach). This means foreign currency risks are largely avoided. The remaining foreign currency risks in the banking book are managed by the Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department within the limits that the Board of Directors has allocated.


#### Risks in the trading book

At the Raiffeisen Group, the Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department runs a trading book. In addition, the structured products business of Raiffeisen Switzerland B.V. Amsterdam are being allocated to the trading book.

The market risks of the Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department are strategically restricted using global limits. Risks are operationally limited by scenario limits, loss limits and value-at-risk limits. Trading book activities comprise proprietary trading and structured products trading. Trading book risks are hedged with exchange-traded instruments and OTC derivatives. These trading activities are closely monitored and managed using limits.

All traded products are depicted and assessed as part of a risk management system. This enables trading book risks to be efficiently and effectively assessed, managed and controlled. The Risk & Compliance department monitors positions and market risks daily. The market data and risk models used for this are checked independently for accuracy. Before new products are rolled out, the Risk & Compliance department performs an independent evaluation of the risks.

Assessment of the risk situation with respect to market risks

Market risks mainly result from the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates in the banking book. Interest rate sensitivity in a +100 basis point interest rate shock scenario is CHF -0.41 billion, below the previous year's level. The potential declines in value and losses of earnings are acceptable even in adverse scenarios involving interest rate shocks and stresses.

| in million CHF | 31.12.2022 | 31.12.2023 |
| Sensitivity (+100bp-Shift) | -1,163 | -413 |

Market risks in the trading book are diversified across equities, bonds, interest rates, foreign currencies and precious metals. The expected loss potential amid serious market turmoil is to be considered low relative to total income. Possible losses in such a scenario would be largely attributable to credit spread risks in the bonds asset class. Market risks in the banking book as measured by value-at-risk have reduced year on year.

Market risks are strategically limited by using global limits.

Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland simulate interest rate developments and assess their effects.

## Liquidity risks


### Central liquidity risk management

Raiffeisen Switzerland's Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department centrally manages liquidity risks for Raiffeisen Switzerland and the Raiffeisen Group based on regulatory requirements and internal targets.

The regulatory liquidity requirements apply on a consolidated basis at Raiffeisen Group level, and at an individual institution level to Raiffeisen Switzerland. The individual Raiffeisen banks are exempted from compliance with regulatory liquidity requirements but must still meet internal liquidity requirements.

The Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department manages transfers of liquidity within the Group and ensures that refinancing and liquidity costs are allocated to their originators. The individual banks are required to deposit their portion of the liquidity requirements with Raiffeisen Switzerland and to maintain an appropriate refinancing structure.

The Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department also manages Raiffeisen Switzerland's cash reserves, facilitates the Group's access to the money and capital markets, and ensures these refinanc- ing sources are adequately diversified. It performs regular stress tests and assesses liquidity trends in the Raiffeisen Group on an ongoing basis, taking regulatory and economic requirements into con- sideration. The Risk & Compliance department independently monitors liquidity risks.

Further information on liquidity risk management and the liquidity positions can be found in the regulatory disclosure pursuant to FINMA Circular 2016/1 "Disclosure - banks".


#### Assessment of the risk situation with respect to liquidity risks

The Raiffeisen Group's liquidity situation is robust thanks to its focus on the domestic savings and mortgage business. Given the low dependency on major clients and broad diversification with private clients, there is little concentration of sources of funding. Loans to clients are funded largely by customer deposits and additionally by central mortgage institution loans and Raiffeisen bonds. The money market is used primarily for tactical management of the liquidity buffer. This maximises the immunisation against risks on the money market.

The liquidity situation continues to be supported by a high customer deposit coverage ratio, which fell slightly during the year. By the end of the year, 93.4% of loans were refinanced through customer deposits, and as a consequence, loans can continue to be almost fully funded from customer deposits.


##### Operational risks

Operational or business risks arise in two ways: as a consequence of banking transactions carried out by the Raiffeisen Group and by virtue of its function as an employer and owner/occupier of real estate. Viability and cost/benefit analyses determine whether a business risk should be avoided, reduced, transferred or borne. These risks are assessed in terms of the expected probability of occur- rence and financial losses. They also take into account any financial losses that could arise from legal or compliance risks. The analysis of the operational risks is supplemented by an assessment of the qualitative impact of a given risk event, for example on reputation.

Every year, the Raiffeisen Group carries out extensive operational risk assessments. The information obtained is documented in a Group-wide risk register. This forms the basis for monitoring and man- aging the overall profile of operational risks.

Due to the focus on the domestic savings and mortgage business, Raiffeisen's liquidity situation is robust.

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->


###### Information security

Information security - a discipline focused on data confidentiality, integrity and availability - is becoming increasingly important. Cybercriminals pose the biggest threat in this regard. For this reason, information security risks must be comprehensively managed. A regular assessment of the threat situation constitutes the basis for this. Appropriate and effective measures for safeguarding infor- mation and infrastructure are implemented for this purpose and continuously extended. Raiffeisen complies with recognised standards and established practices throughout this process. Considerable importance is attached to protecting financial privacy, banking secrecy and personal data.


####### Internal control system

Raiffeisen's internal control system (ICS) comprises all the control structures and processes intended to ensure the proper conduct of operations, compliance with statutory, regulatory and internal provisions, and complete, reliable reporting.

The framework that underlies the Group ICS and ensures its functionality is defined at the control environment level. The elements of the control environment include internal regulations, independent supervisory bodies, organisational charts and job profiles.

Processes, risks and controls are closely interconnected at the process level. The major operational risks are identified and assessed for each process, and key controls defined accordingly. All key controls are documented and incorporated in the processes. There are many other risk reduction measures in addition to the key controls.

The Raiffeisen Group carries out an assessment of the ICS's appropriateness and effectiveness at least once a year. The implementation of improvements derived from the assessment is tracked and monitored. ICS reporting is included in the standard risk report prepared for the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland and the Raiffeisen banks.


### Early warning system of the Raiffeisen banks

Raiffeisen Switzerland operates an early warning system designed to quickly identify adverse devel- opments at Raiffeisen banks, and avert any potential damage. The early warning system comprises quantitative risk indicators for the individual Raiffeisen banks and an ad-hoc reporting process for integrating qualitative information. Early warning events are analysed and, if necessary, resolved through the Raiffeisen banks with the active involvement of Raiffeisen Switzerland as part of the supervisory function. Early warning events are independently assessed and monitored by the Early Warning System Coordination Committee.


#### Business continuity management

Within the scope of business continuity management (BCM), Raiffeisen has adopted extensive mea- sures to maintain operations even if critical resources become unavailable (staff, IT, buildings, suppliers). The specialist departments have various strategy options for keeping critical business processes functioning. Redundancy for all important IT components has been established and/or expanded at various sites.

Even in exceptional circumstances, Raiffeisen is in the position to safeguard the continued operation of its services.

To minimise potential losses and enable management to respond in an effective, coordinated fashion, Raiffeisen has put together crisis response teams and developed emergency plans in all important company units. It performs regular tests and drills to ensure the plans and organisational structures work properly and do not need to be updated. The crisis management team and organisation are regularly trained and tested using various scenarios to maintain BCM capabilities.

Raiffeisen regularly assesses the latent threat situation and takes steps if necessary.

The major operational risks are assessed and appropriate controls are implemented.

##### Risks in investment business

Risks in investment business are comprised first, by the associated operational risks and second, by risks relating to client custody accounts, which affect the Group indirectly in the form of legal and compliance risks as well as reputational risks. Raiffeisen Switzerland's Risk & Compliance department ensures independent monitoring of compliance with the investment guidelines for the asset man- agement mandates, model portfolios used in investment advice, and funds.


###### Assessment of the risk situation with respect to operational risks

Overall, the operational risks are well within the risk budget defined by the Board of Directors. The comprehensive ICS keeps losses attributable to operational errors low.

The threat situation is becoming more severe due to the increasing number and sophistication of cyber attacks. The increasing importance of data and digital business models is reflected in the ongoing strengthening of the Cyber Security & Defence Centre to ensure effective cyber security.


####### Legal and compliance risks

Every year, the Risk & Compliance department prepares a risk profile of legal and compliance risks (including an assessment of market conduct risks and an analysis of money-laundering risks, taking into account the area of activity and the type of business relationships that are maintained). Based on this profile, the department develops a risk-sensitive action plan, which is approved by the Executive Board with information from the Board of Directors, and is subsequently implemented.

The Risk & Compliance department reports on significant changes in legal and compliance risks to the Executive Board and the Risk Committee of Raiffeisen Switzerland's Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. In addition, twice a year the activities of the Compliance function are reported to the Executive Board, the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and, once a year, to the full Board of Directors.

Raiffeisen Switzerland's Risk & Compliance department supports all of the Raiffeisen Group's units in legal matters for risk prevention in individual cases. It ensures adequate regulatory competence at all levels, monitors and analyses relevant legal developments, and actively manages legal risks. The Risk & Compliance department coordinates interactions with external lawyers where necessary.

Compliance is understood to mean adherence to all applicable statutory, regulatory and professional provisions and internal requirements with a view to identifying risks at an early stage, preventing such risks and ensuring that business is conducted properly. The Risk & Compliance department supports risk carriers from the first and second lines of defence at the Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland in their responsibility to ensure compliance. Raiffeisen takes a comprehensive approach to compliance. Legal and compliance risks are monitored using key risk indicators and through risk prevention in individual cases.

As a domestic retail bank, Raiffeisen operates predominantly in Switzerland. Apart from the provisions of Swiss legislation, however, it must also comply with relevant international provisions when providing banking and other services. Raiffeisen attaches particular importance to combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism - which is also a focal risk for domestically orientated retail banks - and to implementing national and international economic sanctions and complying with them.

Assessment of the risk situation with respect to legal and compliance risks

Regulatory pressure has intensified, which has led to a generally heightened risk situation for Raiffeisen (e.g. new requirements for the prevention of money laundering). Within Raiffeisen, there are clearly defined principles concerning the organisation, competence and responsibility of the control functions. To keep up with the evolving landscape, Raiffeisen Switzerland's second line of defence - independent risk control - and the second line of defence of Raiffeisen banks are developed on an ongoing basis. The changing legal and regulatory developments are continuously analysed, and appropriate con- sideration is given to them in the development of the business model, as well as in the adaptation of regulations and processes. The existing legal and compliance processes are also continuously updated and digitalised to allow Raiffeisen to appropriately control, monitor, and manage its risk in accordance with its risk appetite.

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->


#### ESG-related financial risks

ESG-related financial risks are risks originating from Environment, Social or Governance areas that could negatively impact Raiffeisen. These risks are taken into account as possible risk drivers when managing all the risk categories.

Some of these risks are climate-related financial risks (Environment). They are divided into physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks result from acute extreme weather events such as flooding or from chronic changes in climatic conditions such as global warming. Physical risks affect the credit risk arising from financing arrangements in particular. Transition risks result from changes in circum- stances, technology or social values, along with their impact on the markets. They arise for example if new levies are charged, or if investors increasingly include climate risk considerations in their decision-making.

At Raiffeisen, the impact of ESG-related financial risks on the existing risk categories is systematically analysed. In the case of climate-related financial risks, scenarios are additionally calculated and risk indicators are applied. The Risk & Compliance department at Raiffeisen Switzerland ensures that ESG-related financial risks are monitored on an ongoing basis, supported by a cross-department ESG committee.

There is detailed information on climate-related financial risks in the separate note to the Annual Report "Disclosure of climate-related information according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)", which can be viewed at report.raiffeisen.ch/en/download.

Assessment of the risk situation with respect to ESG-related financial risks With regard to the Environmental factor, the available data indicates that climate change does not have any significant impact on Raiffeisen's risk profile. The transition risks basically affect all risk categories, while the physical risks mainly affect credit risks. The impact of the physical risks is diver- sified by the geographical distribution of financing throughout Switzerland.

Raiffeisen has a Group governance structure with execu- tive bodies and owners' committees, corresponding both to statutory requirements and the way the Raiffeisen Group works. Each Raiffeisen bank is a legally and or- ganisationally independent cooperative. The cooperative members are the members of each bank. All Raiffeisen banks collectively form a community and are mutually liable. They are amalgamated into the Raiffeisen Switzer- land Cooperative, of which they are 100% owners. Raiffeisen Switzerland creates the basic conditions for the business activities of the Raiffeisen banks, and acts as a centre of competence for the entire Group.

Corporate governance principles
===

The Raiffeisen Group's most important corporate governance provisions are established in the Articles of Association, the organisational regulations, the Terms and Conditions of Business, and a series of other instructions and directives. All the statutes and documents relevant to the business (such as the Articles of Association, regulations, instructions, product catalogues, forms and descriptions of processes) are outlined in an electronic system of rules. The binding nature of the regulations and the regulatory documentation obligations are clearly defined. New issues, processes, products and amendments to existing ones can be handled centrally and made available to provide extensive information directly to all staff thanks to the electronic system of rules.

The following information is largely based on the SIX Swiss Exchange Directive Corporate Governance (DCG). While the DCG is not generally binding for Raiffeisen, its application can be reasonable for unlisted companies like a cooperative as well. Matters not relevant for Raiffeisen Group owing to its form of organisation are only mentioned in exceptional cases.

The report deals in particular with the cooperative organisational structure of the Raiffeisen Group. The various levels of decision-making authority and responsibility are also presented and explained. Except where stated otherwise, all data pertain to the reporting date of 31 December 2023.


## Subsequent events

The following subsequent event falling under the ad hoc disclosure requirement occurred at the Raiffeisen Group between the balance sheet date (31 December 2023) and the editorial deadline (19 March 2024) of this Annual Report.


### Criminal proceedings against Dr Pierin Vincenz

Raiffeisen is the aggrieved party and is therefore represented as a private litigant in the criminal proceedings. In February 2024 the Higher Court of the Canton of Zurich overturned the judgment of Zurich District Court of 11 April 2022 and 22 August 2022. Raiffeisen Switzerland acknowledges this decision. Raiffeisen Switzerland will not comment on the ongoing proceedings.

## Raiffeisen banks

The 219 Raiffeisen banks with a total of 784 branches are legally and organisationally independent cooperatives which elect their own directors and have an independent auditor. The banks' strategic management is adapted to regional conditions. Raiffeisen banks are owned by the cooperative members. These may be natural persons or legal entities. They elect the members of the Board of Directors of their Raiffeisen bank at a local General Meeting.

Resolutions and elections require an absolute majority of the votes, except where the law or Articles of Association provide otherwise. In the event of a tied vote, the matter is debated further and a second vote will be held. If this too is tied, the motion will be rejected. The General Meeting is convened at least 10 days before the meeting day by the Board of Directors. The invitation including the agenda items must be issued personally and in writing. At the same time, the Annual Report has to be laid out in client rooms.

Raiffeisen banks align their business activities to reflect the local circumstances.

## Regional unions

The Raiffeisen banks are grouped into 21 regional unions organised as associations. The regional unions promote and support the connection between the Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland. The duties of the regional unions include coordinating regional advertising activities, holding training events for the Raiffeisen banks, and safeguarding and representing the interests of the Raiffeisen banks in dealings with cantonal business associations and authorities.

## Raiffeisen Switzerland

Raiffeisen banks own 100% of Raiffeisen Switzerland. Raiffeisen Switzerland is a cooperative. Any bank with a cooperative structure that recognises the model articles of association of Raiffeisen banks and the Articles of Association and regulations of Raiffeisen Switzerland can join.

Raiffeisen Switzerland bears responsibility for the Raiffeisen Group's business policy and strategy, and acts as a centre of competence for the entire Group. Its tasks include risk controlling, consolidated monitoring, central bank functions (monetary settlement, liquidity maintenance and refinancing), interbank business and securities trading. Raiffeisen Switzerland also informs, advises and supports the Raiffeisen banks in management, marketing, business, information technology, training, human resources and legal services. In addition, it represents Raiffeisen's national and international interests.

Raiffeisen Switzerland acts as a centre of competence for the entire banking group.

## Owners' committees

Rules for collaboration between Raiffeisen Switzerland's executive bodies and its owners are set out in the Articles of Association of Raiffeisen Switzerland and in the regulations of the owners' com- mittees. The Owners' Meeting, an independent body comprising the Raiffeisen banks, is responsible for the owners' strategy and the structure of the owners' committees. The Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland regularly communicates with the committee of the Raiffeisen Bank Council regarding strategic issues. The expert committees act as sounding boards for initiatives, schemes and projects, and bring the Raiffeisen banks' needs to bear at an operational level. The owners' committees have no decision-making authority with regard to Raiffeisen Switzerland. Their purpose is to share views.

</figure>



## Owners' Meeting (OM)

The Owners' Meeting is where the Raiffeisen banks independently come together. Each Raiffeisen bank has one vote and is represented by one person in this body. The OM issues the owners' strategy and sets up an organisational structure for the Raiffeisen banks in order to exchange views with Raiffeisen Switzerland. The meeting is convened as often as business dictates. Usually, it is convened once a year immediately before Raiffeisen Switzerland's Ordinary General Meeting.

At the Owners' Meeting, the participants take note of information provided by the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland regarding the implementation of the owners' strategy as well as statements issued by the Raiffeisen Bank Council regarding the implementation of the owners' strategy. The Raiffeisen Bank Council also provides information on the compensation paid to members of the owners' committees (RB Council, Expert Committee Coordination and expert committees). The OM reaches consultative decisions about key political and strategic owner issues. The 2023 OM was held in Lausanne-Crissier on 15 June 2023, chaired by Bruno Poli, Chairman of the Raiffeisen Bank Council.

The Owners' Meeting sets the owners' strategy and lays down the structure of the owners' committees.

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->


### Raiffeisen Bank Council (RB Council)

The RB Council was established to institutionalise collaboration between the Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland. The RB Council serves as a bridge between the Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland through a structured process for sharing opinions on strategy and business policy. In addition to reflecting on and assessing strategic and business policy issues, the RB Council presents the Raiffeisen banks' perspective as the Raiffeisen Group continues to evolve. The RB Council does not assume any tasks or powers from the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland; instead, the RB Council acts as its sounding board.

The structured approach and communication of opinions that the Raiffeisen banks have formulated among themselves aim to strengthen and legitimise confidence in the relationship between the Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland. Council members back decisions made by the RB Council in keeping with their collective responsibility for decisions.

The RB Council conducted its business in three meetings. The meetings, which serve as a platform to exchange views and ideas are organised by the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland. Four meetings between the RB Council and the Board of Directors were held in 2023, two of them in person and two digitally. Bruno Poli was Chairman of the RB Council during the period under review, with Marlis Pfeiffer as Vice-Chair.


## Expert Committee Coordination (ECC)

ECC exchanges views with the Executive Board of Raiffeisen Switzerland regarding operational issues. Being the senior governing body for the expert committees, it coordinates the activities of the various standing expert committees.

ECC has no veto rights or decision-making authority of its own with regard to issues which are in Raiffeisen Switzerland's area of responsibility. Its structured approach and constructive communication of opinions aims to strengthen confidence in the relationship between the Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland.

ECC conducted its business in five meetings. The Chairman of ECC is Hermann Marti, the Vice-Chair- man is Markus Jäger.


### Expert committees

The expert committees are advisory bodies that constantly communicate with Raiffeisen Switzerland on operational decision-making. They reflect on and assess initiatives, schemes and projects. They present the Raiffeisen banks' perspective and needs, particularly when new products, services, pro- cesses and systems are being developed. The expert committees have no veto rights or decision-mak- ing authority of their own with regard to issues which are in Raiffeisen Switzerland's area of responsibility.

There are currently seven expert committees (Products & Investment Services, IT, Finance & Human Resources, Operating Services, Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets, Risk & Compliance, Raiffeisen Banks Services), which exchanged information with the departments of Raiffeisen Switzerland in three cycles of meetings during the year under review.


## Group companies

Group companies are defined as all majority interests with more than 50% of the voting capital. The key fully consolidated Group companies and the shareholdings valued according to the equity method are listed in El note 7 to the consolidated annual financial statements (companies in which the bank holds a permanent direct or indirect significant participation). Raiffeisen Group companies have no cross-shareholdings. The following diagram shows the scope of consolidation.

The Raiffeisen Bank Council serves as a sounding board for the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland.

The expert committees advise Raiffeisen Switzer- land on operational issues and present the Raiffeisen banks' viewpoint.

Capital structure and liability
===


## Capital structure

Raiffeisen's cooperative model is geared towards the retention of earnings. This means that - with the exception of interest on cooperative shares - net profit is not paid out in dividends, but is instead channelled into the Raiffeisen banks' reserves to strengthen the capital base. The Raiffeisen Group's cooperative capital totals CHF 3.41 billion. A precise breakdown and accounting of changes in the year under review are provided in £ note 16 to the consolidated annual financial statements.

The undistributed net profit strengthens the capital base of the Raiffeisen banks.


## Changes in equity capital

Resigning cooperative members have the right to redeem their share certificates at their intrinsic value up to a maximum of their par value. The Board of Directors may refuse to redeem share cer- tificates at any time and without giving reasons. Share certificates bear interest at a maximum rate of 6%.

| Total equity capital | 17,478 | 18,444 | 19,179 | 20,673 | 22,378 |


## Liability

The Raiffeisen Group guarantees its financial obligations through a balanced system of security measures based on mutual liability, set out in its Articles of Association. Working together in a cooperative union is also a strong expression of solidarity, as the Raiffeisen banks are closely linked as a risk-sharing group. Along with the solidarity fund, Raiffeisen Switzerland is also able to cover claims and operating losses beyond what the individual members could afford.


## Liability of Raiffeisen Switzerland towards the Raiffeisen banks

In its capacity as principal party, Raiffeisen Switzerland guarantees the liabilities of all Raiffeisen banks. A total of CHF 2.95 billion in equity capital of Raiffeisen Switzerland is available for this purpose. Under the Articles of Association of Raiffeisen Switzerland, the Raiffeisen banks must acquire two share certificates for CHF 1,000 for each CHF 100,000 of their total business volume as calculated in accordance with the financial accounting procedures.1 As at 31 December 2023 this corresponded to a call-in obligation towards Raiffeisen Switzerland of CHF 6.1 billion, of which CHF 2.5 billion has been paid in. Raiffeisen Switzerland has the right to call in the outstanding CHF 3.6 billion payment obligation from the Raiffeisen banks at any time.

<!-- Footnote="1 This total business volume includes the balance sheet total and securities held in custody accounts (excluding the bank's own cash bonds held in these accounts." -->

![](figures/95)

<!-- FigureContent="Raiffeisen Group Annual Report 2023" -->

</figure>



## Solidarity fund

The solidarity fund - in line with the cooperative notion of solidarity that Raiffeisen espouses - is an organisation-wide reserve to cover risks. The fund mainly covers operating losses of Raiffeisen banks. It is financed by contributions from the Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland. The disposable fund assets as at 31 December 2023 amounted to CHF 340.8 million.


## Duty of the Raiffeisen banks to pay in further capital towards Raiffeisen Switzerland

Under Article 871 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, the Raiffeisen banks are bound by the duty to pay in further capital up to the amount of their own funds, defined as the disclosed equity capital plus hidden reserves. The duty of the Raiffeisen banks to pay in further capital towards Raiffeisen Switzerland as at 31 December 2023 amounts to CHF 21.9 billion.


## Directive authority of Raiffeisen Switzerland vis-à-vis Raiffeisen banks

According to the FINMA Circular of 11 November 2020, the Raiffeisen Group must comply with the statutory provisions on capital adequacy, risk diversification and liquidity on a consolidated basis. The Raiffeisen banks are exempt from compliance with these provisions at the individual bank level. The conditions for this exemption are that the Raiffeisen banks must join together with Raiffeisen Switzer- land, which guarantees all the Raiffeisen banks' obligations, and must grant Raiffeisen Switzerland power to exercise directive authority vis-à-vis the Raiffeisen banks. Raiffeisen Switzerland monitors the Raiffeisen banks' overall position on an ongoing basis, specifically with regard to capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity and risk diversification. If an unfavourable development occurs or is expected at a Raiffeisen bank, Raiffeisen Switzerland assists in drawing up and implementing appropriate measures. In serious cases, Raiffeisen Switzerland has a right of application and directive authority in respect of organisational, operational and HR-related steps.


## Major cooperative members

Cooperative members must hold at least one share certificate. If so resolved by the Board of Directors of the respective Raiffeisen bank, cooperative members can also subscribe for more than one share certificate, but only up to 10% of the cooperative capital or CHF 20,000 per cooperative member. Under the Swiss Code of Obligations, the voting rights of any one cooperative member are limited to one vote, irrespective of the number of share certificates held. In accordance with this, there are no major cooperative members in the Raiffeisen Group which hold more than 5% of the capital or voting rights. Membership of a Raiffeisen bank and the associated rights and obligations are closely tied to the individual/entity in question. This means that individual shares cannot normally be sold on or transferred. A member can nominate another member, their spouse or a descendant to represent them. No authorised person may represent more than one member. They must have written au- thorisation. Representatives of limited partnerships, collective associations or legal entities also require written authorisation.

The voting rights of any one cooperative member are limited to one vote.

The General Meeting is the supreme executive body of Raiffeisen Switzerland. It is composed of elected Raiffeisen bank representatives, one from each of the 219 Raiffeisen banks. Each Raiffeisen bank can cast one vote at the GM. The 120th Ordinary General Meeting, which was held on 16 June 2023 in Lausanne-Crissier, was attended by 206 Raiffeisen bank representatives with voting rights. Thirteen banks were represented by another Raiffeisen bank.

The General Meeting is composed of Raiffeisen bank representatives, one from each bank.

The GM passes its resolutions and conducts its elections on the basis of the absolute majority of the votes cast, except where the law or Articles of Association stipulate otherwise. To call an Ordinary General Meeting, the date, location and time of the meeting and the deadlines must be announced five months before the meeting. Applications to add items to the agenda must be submitted 12 weeks before the meeting. The agenda agreed by the Board of Directors, the documents supporting reso- lutions and any nominations must be sent out at least four weeks before the meeting. Shorter deadlines are permissible when convening an Extraordinary General Meeting.

The General Meeting has the following powers in particular:

\- changing the Raiffeisen Switzerland Articles of Association;

\- drawing up model articles of association for Raiffeisen banks;

\- defining the Raiffeisen Group's mission statement and long-term policy principles;

\- approving the annual financial statements of Raiffeisen Switzerland, resolution on appropriation of net earnings of Raiffeisen Switzerland, approving the consolidated financial statements of the Raiffeisen Group, approving the management report and the non-financial report (consisting of chapters on sustainability and employees in the management report and supplements to the 2023 Annual Report "Disclosure of climate information in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)" and "GRI content index") of the Raiffeisen Group, and ratifying the actions of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board;

\- appointing and dismissing the members of the Board of Directors, its Chairperson, and the auditor for the purposes of the Swiss Code of Obligations for Raiffeisen Switzerland, and designating the auditor to be elected for the purposes of the Swiss Code of Obligations for Raiffeisen banks.

The discharge of the actions of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board for the financial years 2017 to 2022 was not put on the 2023 agenda due to unresolved matters relating to the past.

###### Information and controlling tools vis-à-vis the Executive Board

The information and controlling tools employed by the Board of Directors have been configured in accordance with the requirements defined by FINMA. The Raiffeisen Group has an established and proven management information system (MIS), which helps the Board of Directors fulfil its supervisory duties and oversee the powers transferred to the Executive Board.

The Board of Directors receives a monthly Management Information report, showing the trend in the key figures and the monthly financial statements of the Raiffeisen Group, Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland. A final, comprehensive financial report is also prepared every quarter, including a year-on-year comparison, actual/plan comparison and expectations for each business segment and the entire Raiffeisen Group. These quarterly reports are supplemented by analyses of relevant issues and developments. The minutes of the Executive Board meetings are also submitted to the Chairman of the Board of Directors for review. In addition, individual members of the Executive Board attend the meetings of the Board of Directors or committees in consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chairperson of the committee, respectively, provide information on current issues and are available to give further details.

Risk and compliance

The Board of Directors is periodically updated on the risk situation. Every year, the Board of Directors is presented with a forward-looking risk analysis that serves to determine the Group's annual risk tolerance and assess its resulting risk capacity. The Board of Directors receives a detailed quarterly risk report on the overall risk situation and the utilisation of the overall limits approved by the Board of Directors.

The Raiffeisen Group has an internal control system (ICS) that supports the proper conduct of business activities based on processes, controls, regulations, directives and corresponding measures. The Board of Directors receives an annual report on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system.

The Raiffeisen Group has a compliance function and a Compliance department to ensure risk-orientated compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. The Board of Directors receives an annual assessment of the compliance risk of the Group's business activities and an activity report from the compliance function. Furthermore, the Board of Directors is given timely information on grave vio- lations of compliance regulations or matters with major implications.

Internal Auditing

The Raiffeisen Group has an Internal Auditing department which reports to the Board of Directors and is independent of the Executive Board. This department supports the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight and control duties and has an unrestricted right to perform audits and obtain information within the Bank. Internal Auditing reports to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.

## Internal Auditing

Internal Auditing supports the corresponding activities within the Raiffeisen Group and supports the Board of Directors and its committees in the performance of their tasks. The tasks and responsibilities of Internal Auditing are set down in regulations issued by the Board of Directors. All operations within the Group are audited by Internal Auditing once every few years with a focus on risk. Auditing activities include the objective and independent review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system (ICS) and risk management, the reliability and integrity of financial and oper- ational information, compliance with requirements set out in laws, regulations and the Articles of Association, and the proper functioning of governance, operational structure and processes. Internal Auditing also checks that weaknesses and shortcomings identified are remedied effectively and permanently. Furthermore, the Board of Directors may use Internal Auditing for special tasks such as special audits, project support or advisory services, provided such engagements do not violate its independence requirements. Internal Auditing has unlimited auditing, information and access rights within the Raiffeisen Group and works closely with the risk control functions and the external auditor.

Internal Auditing has a solid-line reporting relationship with the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland. It has a dotted-line reporting relationship with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and is independent of the Executive Board. Internal Auditing reports to the Audit Committee and, in its additional annual activity report, to the Board of Directors on matters relating to the Group and Raiffeisen Switzerland. Reports for Raiffeisen banks and Group companies are submitted to the appropriate board of directors. Internal Auditing conducts its auditing activities on the basis of an annual, risk-orientated audit schedule that is approved by the Board of Directors and coordinated with the auditing activities of the auditor for the purposes of the Swiss Code of Obligations and the regulatory auditing firm.

Dr Daniel Dal Santo has been the Head of Internal Auditing since 2015. He attends Audit Committee and Risk Committee meetings (nine Audit Committee meetings and seven Risk Committee meetings in 2023). He also attends Board of Directors meetings on selected agenda items. At the end of 2023, the Internal Auditing department consisted of 76 full-time equivalents. It performs its auditing activities in compliance with the professional rules and standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors Switzerland.


## Auditor for the purposes of the Swiss Code of Obligations and regulatory auditing firm

Raiffeisen Switzerland and Raiffeisen Group

On 25 June 2020 the General Meeting of Raiffeisen Switzerland elected Ernst & Young AG as auditor for the purposes of the Swiss Code of Obligations of Raiffeisen Switzerland Cooperative and the Raiffeisen Group for a term of three years (financial years 2021 to 2023) and also designated Ernst & Young AG as an electable auditor for the Raiffeisen banks.

At the General Meeting held on 16 June 2023, the election of Ernst & Young AG as auditor for the purposes of the Swiss Code of Obligations of Raiffeisen Switzerland Cooperative and the Raiffeisen Group was confirmed for a further term of three years (2024-2026) as well as the designation of Ernst & Young AG as an electable auditor for the Raiffeisen banks. Ernst & Young AG was also con- firmed as regulatory auditing firm for the same term.


### Raiffeisen banks

The General Meetings of the Raiffeisen banks elect the auditor for the purposes of the Swiss Code of Obligations for a term of three years in each instance. The General Meetings of the Raiffeisen banks elected Ernst & Young AG in 2021 as the auditor for the purposes of the Swiss Code of Obligations and regulatory auditing firm for a term of three years (2021 to 2023). In 2024, the General Meetings of the Raiffeisen banks re-elected Ernst & Young AG for a further term of three years (2024-2026). Ernst & Young AG is supported by the Internal Auditing department of the Raiffeisen Group in con- ducting regulatory audits of the Raiffeisen banks and audits under the Swiss Code of Obligations.

Prof. Dr Andreas Blumer has been the lead auditor since 2021 and is responsible for auditing the consolidated annual financial statements of the Raiffeisen Group and the annual financial statements of Raiffeisen Switzerland. As lead auditor, he is responsible for the regulatory audit. Philipp de Boer has been coordinating the regulatory audits and the audits under the Swiss Code of Obligations of all Raiffeisen banks since 2021 as the person in charge of the Raiffeisen banks mandate.


### Audit fees The fee for Ernst & Young AG amounted to the following:

| Audit fees |||
| in million CHF | 2022 | 2023 |
| - | - | - |
| Audit fees | 7.2 | 8 1 |
| Additional fees for audit-type services and advisory services | 0.2 | 0.4 |

The audit fees include services in connection with the regular audit of the individual annual financial statements, the Group financial statements and the regulatory audits. The additional fees for audit- type services and advisory services mainly comprise investigations into regulatory issues; compliance with the requirements for independence is monitored by the Audit Committee.


## Information tools available to the regulatory auditing firm

The risk assessment, the audit plan derived from it, and the auditors' reports are examined by the Audit Committee and discussed with the lead auditor. Selected reports are also discussed with the lead auditor at meetings of the Board of Directors. In 2023, the lead auditor attended a total of five Audit Committee meetings and two meetings of the Board of Directors.


## Supervision and control of the external auditor

The auditor, Ernst & Young AG, fulfils the requirements of the Auditor Oversight Act and is licensed by the Federal Audit Oversight Authority to audit banking institutions. Every year the Audit Committee reviews the performance, the fee and the independence of the external auditor. It checks that any advisory appointments are compatible with acting as auditor.

Raiffeisen's remuneration policy is consistent with its cooperative values and underscores the banking Group's "We" culture. Raiffeisen attaches great importance to equal pay for both female and male employees with the same or similar roles and the same functional level. Each Raiffeisen bank defines its remuneration model independently, based on the recommendations of Raiffeisen Switzerland.

## Raiffeisen Switzerland remuneration report

A competitive remuneration model plays a key role for Raiffeisen Switzerland as an employer. The remuneration system is designed to attract skilled employees on the labour market and to retain them over the long term, among other goals.

Raiffeisen Switzerland's remuneration system is based on provisions of laws, rules and regulations, in particular FINMA Circular 2010/1 "Remuneration schemes".


## Remuneration governance

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) consists of three to five members of the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland. The NRC comprises four members for the 2022 to 2024 term of office and has been chaired by Sandra Lathion since 18 June 2022. The NRC is responsible for implementing the remuneration regulations issued by the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland. The NRC also reviews proposals concerning the remuneration of the Executive Board and the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland. It submits recommendations to the Board of Directors for approval of the proposed remuneration. In addition, the NRC and the Board of Directors jointly evaluate the performance of the Chairman of Raiffeisen Switzerland's Executive Board. Together with the Chairman of the Executive Board, the NRC reviews the performance assessments of the other members of Raiffeisen Switzerland's Executive Board.


### Raiffeisen Switzerland's Board of Directors is responsible for the following:

\- outlining the remuneration policy in the form of regulations for Raiffeisen Switzerland and recommendations for the Raiffeisen banks;

\- approving the annual remuneration report submitted to the Board by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee;

\- reviewing its remuneration policy on a regular basis and whenever there are indications that reviews or revisions may be necessary;

\- having the structure and implementation of its remuneration policy checked regularly by external auditors and by Internal Auditing if necessary;

<!-- PageNumber="136" -->

Management report

Corporate governance

<!-- PageHeader="Annual financial statements" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

\- annually determining the total amount of the collective profit-sharing element;

\- defining the fixed component of remuneration and the collective profit-sharing element for members of the Executive Board and the Head of Internal Auditing, including occupational pension contributions.

In the 2023 financial year, the NRC held seven meetings with an attendance rate of 100%. It focused on the following areas:

\- review of employment conditions at Raiffeisen Switzerland;

\- definition of areas for action for ongoing performance dialogue, for strategic employer branding and for talent management, taking into account results from the employee survey;

\- analysis of the results from the employee survey;

\- conducting a comprehensive external assessment of the performance and efficiency of the Board of Directors;

\- quarterly HR reporting with key staffing figures;

\- optimising the remuneration report;

\- intensive dialogue with internal and external stakeholders.


#### Inclusion of additional attendees at meetings

The Chairperson of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee invites other members of the Board of Directors, members of the Executive Board, other experts, remuneration advisors and external legal advisors to attend if needed. The person whose remuneration is being discussed (for example a member of the Executive Board) is not involved.


##### Regular review of operational implementation

Internal Auditing regularly evaluates the operational implementation of the remuneration regulations at Raiffeisen Switzerland, including an audit of the control system and random audits on a case-by- case basis. The audit results from Internal Auditing demonstrate that the provisions of the remuner- ation regulations were complied with in all key aspects.

The remuneration approval structure can be summarised as follows:

| Remuneration approval structure \| Raiffeisen Switzerland |||

| Board of Directors | Recommendation | Approval |
| Total amount of the collective profit-sharing element of Raiffeisen Switzerland | Recommendation | Approval |

At the 2023 General Meeting of Raiffeisen Switzerland, the Board of Directors proposed that the 2022 Remuneration Report be approved in a consultative vote. This proposal was approved by the General Meeting with 95.8% of the votes.

###### Remuneration policy

The Raiffeisen Group's remuneration policy is designed to ensure that the interests of its employees are aligned with those of its clients. The Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland each have their own remuneration model. These models regulate the remuneration paid to members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board in detail, and lay out basic principles for the total remuneration paid to all employees. The Raiffeisen banks are guided by the recommendations of Raiffeisen Switzer- land and local market conditions.

Raiffeisen Switzerland's remuneration model is aligned with the business strategy. It gives due con- sideration to the Group's goals, values, cooperative culture and long-term, sustainable focus. Raiffeisen Switzerland also attaches great importance to a simple and transparent remuneration system.

One of the most important aspects from Raiffeisen Switzerland's viewpoint as an employer remains gender equality, especially when it comes to equal pay. Here, Raiffeisen Switzerland believes in equal pay for equal work. Both the analysis carried out in 2021 and the one in the year under review confirmed that Raiffeisen Switzerland is successful in complying with equal pay for women and men. Raiffeisen was awarded the "Fair ON Pay" certificate for this. The pay equality analysis in 2023 was carried out in collaboration with the external provider Comp-On AG. Apart from this, no other external consultants were called in for remuneration issues or contracted to carry out remuneration projects in the year under review.

The following table contains a summary of the principles of the remuneration policy of Raiffeisen Switzerland.

|||
| - | - |
| Principles of the remuneration policy \| Raiffeisen Switzerland ||
| Transparency | The structure of the remuneration system of Raiffeisen Switzerland is simple and transpar- ent; the principle of "equal pay for equal work" applies as an absolute matter of course. |
| Strategic direction | The remuneration system is aligned with the business strategy. It gives due consideration to the goals, values and cooperative culture, as well as the long-term and sustainable alignment of the Group. |
| Consideration of risk | Incentives are designed to encourage appropriate business conduct and avoid potential conflicts of interest and excessive risk behaviour. |
| Performance orientation | The remuneration system provides adequate incentives to drive and differentiate performance. |
| Market positioning | The remuneration system is attractive enough to recruit talented individuals, motivate them and ensure their long-term loyalty to the company. The appropriateness of the remuneration is reviewed based on regular market comparisons. |


####### Remuneration system

Raiffeisen Switzerland's remuneration system should be attractive enough to recruit new talent, motivate employees and retain them over the long term. The focus is on team performance. Incentives are designed to encourage appropriate business conduct and avoid potential conflicts of interest and excessive risk appetite. Remuneration caps are defined for all risk carriers and employees of Raiffeisen Switzerland. All remuneration is paid in non-deferred cash.

For all employees (including members of the Executive Board, senior management and employees with controlling roles), remuneration comprises the following elements:

\- Fixed remuneration in line with the market Every employee has an individual contract establishing the fixed remuneration. This is based on the defined role, as well as the employee's skills and knowledge. It also has to be competitive in the labour market. The entire fixed remuneration is paid in cash.

\- Collective profit-sharing element The variable remuneration is based on the performance of the Group and is paid out in the form of a collective profit-sharing element. The amount of the collective profit-sharing element is deter- mined annually by the Board of Directors on a discretionary basis, using various metrics and target values. It makes up a small percentage of total remuneration. This low percentage depends on

The remuneration policy aligns the interests of our employees with those of our clients and is based on the principle of "equal pay for equal work".

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Annual financial statements" -->

the pay grade and is therefore the same for all employees at the same pay grade (including mem- bers of the Executive Board and the head of Internal Auditing), regardless of the area they work in. This is Raiffeisen Switzerland's way of emphasising collaboration and collective team spirit. The collective profit-sharing element can be paid to employees in all positions, including those with controlling roles. Special care is taken to prevent the remuneration system giving employees with controlling roles incentives that could cause conflicts of interest with their duties. The collective profit-sharing element is a voluntary, variable benefit provided by Raiffeisen Switzerland as the employer. It is based on the differentiated understanding of roles at Raiffeisen Switzerland as a service provider to the Raiffeisen banks, the implementer of Group projects, and an attractive, progressive and results-orientated employer. Employees generally have no contractual guarantee to be paid a collective profit-sharing element. Any serious breach of internal or external regulations will result in a total or partial loss of collective profit-sharing element at individual level. The col- lective profit-sharing element is the only form of variable remuneration at Raiffeisen Switzerland. There are no other individual bonuses or long-term incentive plans.

In addition, fringe benefits are granted within the framework of applicable regulations and directives and in line with the industry standard.

##### Recognition of special team performance

Raiffeisen Switzerland introduced two recognition programmes on 1 January 2021: Team Players and Team Prize, which have been continued ever since. The Team Players award gives visibility to special achievements of teams, such as organisational units, project teams or working groups, across all hierarchical levels throughout the organisation. Team Players are selected by the employees of Raiffeisen Switzerland. The Team Prize lets managers show recognition of above-average performance all year round, flexibly and unbureaucratically - for example in the form of a joint team event. The focus of both recognition programmes is on team performance. Individual performance has also been recognised with Spot Awards since 2023; like the Team Prize, these can be given out by the manager.

###### Determining remuneration for the Board of Directors

The members of Raiffeisen Switzerland's Board of Directors receive remuneration commensurate with their respective responsibilities and time commitment. Additionally, members belonging to a committee, heading a committee or chairing the Board of Directors receive higher pay. The members of the Board of Directors do not receive a collective profit-sharing element. The Board of Directors has no performance indicators that would encourage unnecessary risk-taking.

In line with the remuneration regulations in force, the Chairman of the Board of Directors received fixed remuneration of CHF 700,000 and was not entitled to receive committee fees. The Deputy Chairman received fixed remuneration of CHF 140,000. The full members of the Board of Directors received fixed remuneration of CHF 90,000. The Chairman of the Board of Directors received a lump- sum expense allowance of CHF 12,000 for his representative duties. The other members of the Board of Directors received an annual lump-sum expense allowance of CHF 6,000.

For their membership of the four committees (the Strategy and Innovation Committee, the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee), the other members of the Board of Directors and the Deputy Chairman also received the following remuneration:

\- As a member: CHF 30,000 - As Chairperson: CHF 50,000

If a member of the Board of Directors is appointed to a position on an interim basis, they are entitled to the remuneration for that interim position. The remuneration table below shows the total remu- neration paid to the individual members of the Board of Directors. The gross remuneration framework of CHF 2.0 million set by the General Meeting in a consultative vote for the financial year 2023 was complied with. Loans granted to members of the Board of Directors are disclosed in the Annual Report in £ note 17. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) is the body responsible for approving loans to members of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is also informed about new business and loan increases for members of the NRC.


## Determining remuneration for the Executive Board

The maximum remuneration for the Executive Board as communicated at the Assembly of Delegates held on 15 June 2019 was once again adhered to in the 2023 year under review. The cap on remu- neration for the Chair of the Executive Board is CHF 1.5 million, and CHF 1.0 million for each of the other members of the Executive Board. The gross remuneration of the Executive Board consists of a fixed remuneration and collective profit-sharing element. The gross remuneration framework of CHF 9.5 million set by the General Meeting in a consultative vote for the 2023 financial year was complied with.


### Fixed remuneration

Fixed remuneration for members of the Executive Board is based on the labour market value, the requirements of the assigned department, management responsibilities and seniority. Each member of the Executive Board receives a fixed basic salary that is reviewed each year by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The members of the Executive Board receive market-standard pension and fringe benefits.


### Collective profit-sharing element

The process and guidelines for setting variable remuneration in the form of a collective profit-sharing element are identical both for the members of the Executive Board and the Head of Internal Auditing, and for all other eligible employees of Raiffeisen Switzerland.

The members of Raiffeisen Switzerland's Board of Directors receive remuneration commensurate with their role.

Management report

Corporate governance

<!-- PageHeader="Annual financial statements" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

The amount of the collective profit-sharing element awarded to the members of the Executive Board is determined annually by the Board of Directors on a discretionary basis, using various metrics and target values. At the same time, the provisions of the remuneration regulations for the members of the Executive Board of Raiffeisen Switzerland, including the maximum upper limit, must be complied with.

The remuneration structure is designed to ensure that the collective profit-sharing element paid to employees with controlling roles in no way depends on the risks they monitor.


#### Remuneration for the Board of Directors

In the year under review, the remuneration principles in place since 1 January 2019 and presented to the Assembly of Delegates in June 2019 continued to apply. As a result, the members of the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland received remuneration (excluding contributions to pension plans and social insurance) totalling CHF 2,000,000 for 2023. This is within the limits of total maximum gross remuneration approved in a consultative vote at the 2022 General Meeting. In addition, the total employer contributions to social insurance and pension plans for the members of the Board of Directors amounted to CHF 450,860 in 2023. Details of the remuneration of the individual Board members and their positions are provided in the table below.

The members of the Board of Directors do not receive a profit- sharing element.

## Remuneration and remuneration recommendations for the Raiffeisen banks

The Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland recommends that the Raiffeisen banks align their respective local remuneration systems to the recommendations made by Raiffeisen Switzerland.

Raiffeisen Switzerland advises the Raiffeisen banks and supports them in structuring and implementing their local remuneration systems while preserving their own responsibility. The most important features of these recommendations are as follows:

\- The remuneration system does not provide incentives to take unreasonable risks. The structure and amount of total remuneration are in line with the risk policy of the Raiffeisen bank and the Raiffeisen Group.

\- The remuneration system is simple, transparent and implementable, and designed to be sustain- able. The remuneration policy strives for consistency, avoids strong fluctuations and does not give rise to conflicts of interest.

\- Remuneration for employees of Raiffeisen banks may involve a fixed and a variable element. - Members of the Board of Directors do not receive any variable remuneration.

\- Fixed remuneration is paid based on the role and the employee's skills and knowledge.

\- The Board of Directors decides on the total sum of the variable remuneration, as well as on the individual allocation of the variable remuneration to the members and Chairman of the Executive Board.

Raiffeisen Switzerland advises the Raiffeisen banks on structuring their local remuneration systems.

The 2023 financial year has been successful for the Raiffeisen Group. It expanded its market position in its core business, granting mortgage loans. Customer depos- its, securities account volumes and income from the client business increased in the year under review.

Income from the neutral business once again exceeded the previous year's outstanding result. Income from com- mission business and services transactions increased by CHF 33.0 million to CHF 624.4 million. Net trading income increased slightly to CHF 255.6 million (+0.5%).

Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
===


## Company name, legal form, registered office

The Raiffeisen Group is a banking group without legal personality. It comprises 219 independent Raiffeisen banks in the legal form of a cooperative, Raiffeisen Switzerland Cooperative domiciled in St. Gallen (Raiffeisen Switzerland) and the associated Group companies. The Raiffeisen banks are cooperative members of Raiffeisen Switzerland and thus members of the cooperative association.


## Risk management

The Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland form a strong risk-sharing group based on the principle of solidarity through their solidarity-based and joint liability scheme.


## Risk policy

Risk management systems are based on regulatory provisions, regulations governing risk policy for the Raiffeisen Group ("risk policy" for short) and the framework and framework concepts for insti- tution-wide risk management. The risk policy, the framework and the framework concepts are reviewed and updated annually. The Raiffeisen Group views risk management as one of its core competencies. It only takes risks that fall within its risk tolerance limits and only if they can be entered into after careful consideration and systematically managed, they offer suitable return potential and the risks can be effectively controlled at all levels. The objectives of the risk policy are to limit the negative impact of risks on earnings and protect the Raiffeisen Group against high, exceptional losses, as well as to preserve and enhance its reputation.


### Risk control

The Raiffeisen Group's risk management is based on the three-lines-of-defence principle: risks are managed by the line units responsible (first line). Raiffeisen Switzerland's Risk & Compliance depart- ment ensures that the risk policy and regulatory provisions are complied with and enforced (second line). In addition, the risk control officers at each of the Raiffeisen banks are responsible for bank-in- ternal risk control. They monitor implementation of the risk policy and actively manage risks within the scope of the risk tolerance defined by the Board of Directors of the Raiffeisen bank (second line). Internal Auditing ensures the independent review of the risk management framework (third line).

The Raiffeisen Group limits and monitors the main risk categories via risk guidelines. Appropriate limits are used for quantifiable risks. Risks that are difficult to quantify are limited by qualitative stipulations.

The Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland is responsible for the independent monitoring of risk in the Raiffeisen Group. This primarily involves monitoring compliance with the limits and warning thresholds stipulated by the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. The Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland also assesses the risk situation on a regular basis as part of the reporting process.

Monitoring of the subsidiaries is tailored to the relevant risk profiles. These are periodically reviewed. Raiffeisen Switzerland monitors the minimum risk management requirements. There is a periodic exchange with the risk control owners.

Raiffeisen Switzerland conducts various regular stress tests to analyse the impact of adverse scenarios on the resilience of the Raiffeisen Group. This involves examining the influence on important target values, such as the result, capital requirements and liquidity. The stress test analyses are carried out at the overall Bank level or at the level of certain sub-portfolios or risk categories. Moreover, as a systemically important banking group, Raiffeisen Switzerland carries out reverse stress tests for the Raiffeisen Group as part of its stabilisation and emergency planning.

Conducting stress tests is an integral part of risk monitoring within the Raiffeisen Group. The Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland determines the risk appetite on the basis of the stress test at Group level.


## Risk management process

The risk management process applies to all risk categories and includes the following elements:

\- risk identification; - risk measurement and assessment; - risk management; - risk monitoring and reporting.

The Raiffeisen Group's risk management systems aim to:

\- ensure that effective controls are in place at all levels and to ensure that any entering into risks is in line with risk tolerance;

\- create the conditions for entering into and systematically managing risks in a deliberate, targeted and controlled manner;

\- make the best possible use of risk tolerance, i.e. ensure that risks are only entered into if they offer suitable return potential.


## Credit risks

The Raiffeisen banks and Raiffeisen Switzerland manage their credit risks autonomously, although still in accordance with Group-wide standards.

Credit risks are defined in the risk policy as the risk of losses that arise if clients or other counterparties fail to make contractually agreed payments to the extent expected. Credit risks are inherent in loans, irrevocable credit commitments, contingent liabilities and trading products such as OTC derivative contracts. Risks also arise from taking on long-term equity exposures.

The Raiffeisen Group identifies, assesses, manages and monitors the following risks in its lending activities:

\- creditworthiness risks; - collateral risks; - concentration risks; - country risks

Creditworthiness risks refer to the risk of default or a deterioration in credit quality of a borrower, counterparty or issuer. Default occurs when receivables are overdue or at risk.

Collateral risks refer to impairments in the value of collateral.

Concentration risks in credit portfolios arise from the unfavourable distribution of credit receivables originating from individual borrowers, sectors, regions, rating classes and collateral.

Country risks refer to the risk of losses resulting from country-specific events.

Retail banking in Switzerland is the Raiffeisen Group's core business. The main component of this is financing for loans secured by mortgages.

For the individual Raiffeisen banks, the main risks are credit, collateral and concentration risks. The majority of these risks result from loans granted to private and corporate clients and public-sector entities. Corporate clients are mainly small and medium-sized companies that operate within the business areas of Raiffeisen banks. Credit risks are limited primarily by securing the underlying claims. This notwithstanding, creditworthiness and solvency are key prerequisites for granting loans. Raiffeisen banks are limited in the acceptance of credit risks arising from uncovered credit transactions for corporate clients; uncovered loans to corporate clients exceeding a defined amount must be approved and hedged by Raiffeisen Switzerland. The maximum unsecured loan amount is limited and depends on the level of the bank's capital. Uncovered loans to private clients are generally not possible, or only in exceptional cases with the prior approval of Raiffeisen Switzerland.

Larger loans to corporate clients and public-sector entities are primarily granted and managed by Raiffeisen Switzerland's Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department. Concentration risks as part of the credit process are reviewed and acknowledged.

The Group-wide responsibilities of the Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department of Raiffeisen Switzerland involve managing both domestic and international counterparty risks. These risks occur in transactions involving investments in money and capital markets, hedging currency and interest rate risks and proprietary trading. In principle, international transactions may only be conducted when country-specific limits have been approved and established.

Pursuant to the Articles of Association, Raiffeisen Switzerland's commitments abroad may not exceed 5% of the Raiffeisen Group balance sheet total on a risk-weighted basis.

Internal and external ratings are used as a basis for approving and monitoring business with other commercial banks. Off-balance-sheet transactions and derivative financial instruments are converted to their respective credit equivalent. The standard SA-CCR approach is applied when calculating the credit equivalents of derivative financial instruments. Raiffeisen Switzerland, including Raiffeisen Switzerland B.V. Amsterdam, has entered into framework agreements for OTC derivative transactions (the Swiss or ISDA master agreement) with the counterparties of Raiffeisen Switzerland's Corporate Clients' Treasury & Markets department with whom OTC derivative transactions are executed and, depending on the counterparty, a credit support annex for variation margin. Collateral is exchanged by transferring the margin requirement, which is calculated daily. These OTC exposures are monitored taking into account the collateral exchanged.

Raiffeisen Switzerland has invested in other companies as part of strategic cooperation partnerships. Details are provided in the information on the balance sheet contained in ] note 7.

Creditworthiness and solvency are assessed on the basis of binding Group-wide standards. Sufficient creditworthiness and the ability to maintain payments must be proved before any loan is approved. Loans to private and corporate clients, as well as investment property financing, are classified accord- ing to rating models and subject to risk monitoring based on the resulting classification. Clients' creditworthiness is split into 11 risk categories and 2 default categories.

This system has proved its worth as a means of dealing with the main elements of credit risk man- agement, i.e. risk-adjusted pricing, portfolio management, identification and recognition of individual value adjustments. Specialist teams are available at Raiffeisen Switzerland for complex financing arrangements and the management of recovery positions.

Comprehensive internal sets of rules exist for valuing collateral for loans, especially for determining the loan-to-value ratios; they prescribe the corresponding methods, procedure and competencies. The sets of rules are constantly reviewed and adjusted to regulatory requirements and market changes. The Bank employs recognised estimation methods, tailored to the type of real estate, to value property loans secured by security interests in land. Hedonic models, the gross rental method and expert estimates are used, among other things. Both the models used and the individual valuations are reviewed regularly. The maximum lending amount for any property loan secured by security interests in land varies depending on the realisability of the collateral and is affected by the type and form of use.

Raiffeisen analyses loan positions for default risk at regular intervals and/or in response to certain events and recognises value adjustments and/or loan loss provisions as needed. The Bank considers loans to be impaired when it becomes unlikely that debtors will be able to meet their future obligations or the loan is no longer covered by the intrinsic value of any collateral, but at the very latest when the contractual principal, interest or commission payments are more than 90 days overdue. Provisions are recognised for the full amount of the interest and commission payments.

Raiffeisen Switzerland monitors, controls and manages risk concentrations within the Group, in particular for individual counterparties and for groups of affiliated counterparties, as well as for sectors and collateral. The process of identifying and consolidating affiliated counterparties is largely automated across the entire Raiffeisen Group. Raiffeisen Switzerland monitors the credit portfolio on a Group-wide basis and evaluates the portfolio structure. A periodic credit portfolio report provides the decision-makers responsible with information on the economic environment, the structure of the credit portfolio, the risk situation and developments in the period under review.

Monitoring the portfolio structure involves analysing the distribution of the portfolio according to a range of structural characteristics, including, without limitation, category of borrower, type of loan, size of loan, rating, sector, collateral, geographical features and value adjustments. The Executive Board and the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland receive a quarterly risk report detailing the risk situation, risk exposure, limit utilisation and changes in exception-to-policy loans. In addition to standard credit portfolio reporting, Raiffeisen Switzerland's Risk & Compliance department also conducts ad hoc risk analyses where required. Monitoring and reporting form the basis for portfolio controlling measures, with the main focus being on controlling new business via lending policy.

Cluster risks are monitored centrally by the Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland. As at 31 December 2023, the Raiffeisen Group had two cluster risks.

As at 31 December 2023, the total of the regulatory reporting of Raiffeisen Switzerland's 20 biggest overall exposures, after risk mitigation and risk weighting, amounted to CHF 1.0 billion, taking into account the prescribed threshold (2% of the capital valuation basis).


## Market risks


### Banking book

Risk associated with fluctuating interest rates: since interest rates for assets and liabilities are locked in for different periods, fluctuations in market interest rates can have a considerable impact on the interest income and annual results of Raiffeisen Group. Value at risk is calculated along with interest rate sensitivity in various interest rate shock scenarios in order to assess the assumed interest rate risk to the net present value of the equity capital. The impact on profitability is assessed using dynamic income simulations. To measure mark-to-market risk, a gap analysis is performed using all on-bal- ance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items along with their maturities. Loans and deposits with non-fixed maturities and capital commitment periods are modelled on the basis of historical data and for- ward-looking scenarios. These models are backtested at least once a year and undergo regular independent validation. No specific assumptions are made for early loan repayments because early repayment penalties are normally levied.

<!-- PageNumber="156" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

Risks associated with fluctuating interest rates are managed on a decentralised basis in the business units responsible, with the persons responsible in each case being required to strictly adhere to the limits set by the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. Interest rate risks are hedged using established instruments. Raiffeisen Switzerland's Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department is the binding counterparty for wholesale funding and hedging transactions for the entire Group. The Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland monitors compliance with interest risk limits and prepares the associated quarterly reports, while also assessing the Raiffeisen Group's risk situation. Monitoring and reporting is conducted more frequently for individual units.

Other market risks: since assets in a foreign currency are generally refinanced in the same currency, foreign currency risks can largely be avoided by the Raiffeisen banks.

The financial investment portfolio is managed by the Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department of Raiffeisen Switzerland. Financial investments are part of the liquidity reserve of the Raiffeisen Group and contain largely high-grade fixed-income securities that meet statutory liquidity requirements for high-quality liquid assets (HQLA). The Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland monitors the market risk of financial investments.


### Trading book

The Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department of Raiffeisen Switzerland is responsible for managing Raiffeisen Switzerland's trading book. The Raiffeisen banks do not keep any trading books. Trading activities comprise interest rates, foreign currencies, equities, banknotes/precious metals, and structured products based on equity derivatives. The structured products issuing business of Raiffeisen Switzerland B.V. Amsterdam is also allocated to the trading book. There must be strict adherence to the value-at-risk, scenario, position and loss limits set by the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, which the Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland monitors on a daily basis. In addition, the Risk & Compliance department conducts daily plausibility checks of the valuation parameters used to produce profit and loss figures for trading.

Reporting on compliance with value-at-risk, scenario, position and loss limits and the assessment of the risk situation by the Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland is conducted at a frequency ranging from daily to quarterly and sent to the members of the Executive Board responsible, the Executive Board and the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland.

The Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland communicates breaches of market risk limits set by the Board of Directors and the Executive Board on an ad hoc basis within the scope of the respective risk reports.


### Liquidity risks

Liquidity risks are managed centrally for Raiffeisen Group by the Corporate Clients, Treasury & Markets department of Raiffeisen Switzerland in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and commercial criteria and are monitored by the Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland. Risk management involves, in particular, simulating liquidity inflows and outflows over different time horizons using Group-wide scenarios. These scenarios cover the impact of liquidity shocks that are specific to Raiffeisen or affect the market as a whole.

Monitoring is based on statutory minimum requirements and the limits and internal stress scenarios stipulated by the Board of Directors.

#### Operational risks

At Raiffeisen, operational risks refer to the danger of losses arising as a result of the unsuitability or failure of internal procedures, people or systems, or as a result of external events. They also include risks relating to cyber attacks and information security, as well as risks in investment business in general. Potential financial losses resulting from the legal or compliance risks are also taken into account, as well as the impact on reputation.

Operational risk tolerance is defined at Group level using value-at-risk limits or stop-loss limits and frequencies of occurrence. Risk tolerance is approved annually by the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland. Raiffeisen Switzerland's Risk & Compliance department monitors compliance with risk tolerance. If one of the defined limits or a threshold is exceeded, suitable action is defined and taken.

Each role within the Raiffeisen Group includes identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring operational risks arising from its own activities. The Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland is responsible for maintaining the Group-wide inventory of operational risks and for analysing and evaluating operational risk data. Risk identification and assessment are supported by capturing and analysing operational events. Risk & Compliance is also in charge of the concepts, methods and instruments used to manage operational risks, and it monitors the risk situation. In specific risk assessments, operational risks are identified, categorised by cause and impact, and evaluated according to the frequency of occurrence and the extent of losses. The risk register is updated dynamically. Risk reduction measures are defined and their implementation is monitored by the line units. Emergency and disaster planning measures are in place for mission-critical processes.

The results of the risk assessments, key risk indicators, significant internal operational risk events and relevant external events are reported quarterly to Raiffeisen Switzerland's Executive Board and Board of Directors. Value-at-risk limit violations are escalated to the Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland.

In addition to the standard risk management process, Raiffeisen Switzerland's Risk & Compliance department conducts ad hoc risk analyses where required, analyses any loss events that arise and maintains close links with other organisational units that, as a result of their function, come into contact with information on operational risks within the Raiffeisen Group.

The Raiffeisen banks analyse their operational risk situation through assessments at least once a year. These analyses are approved by the Board of Directors of each bank and forwarded to the Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland.

In the context of operational risks in investment business, compliance with the investment guidelines for asset management mandates, model portfolios used in investment advice as well as index-tracking funds is monitored independently in the Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland. The relevant key risk indicators are reported to the Raiffeisen Switzerland Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.


### Legal and compliance risks

Every year, the Risk & Compliance department of Raiffeisen Switzerland prepares a risk profile of legal and compliance risks (including an assessment of market conduct risks and an analysis of money-laun- dering risk, taking into account the area of activity and the type of business relationships that are maintained). Based on this profile, the department develops a risk-sensitive action plan, which is approved by the Executive Board with information provided to the Board of Directors, and is subse- quently implemented.

<!-- PageNumber="158" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

The Risk & Compliance department reports on significant changes in legal and compliance risks to the Executive Board and the Risk Committee of Raiffeisen Switzerland's Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, as well as on significant legal developments and their implications for the Raiffeisen Group. In addition, twice a year the activities of the Compliance function are reported to the Executive Board, the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and, once a year, to the full Board of Directors.


### ESG-related financial risks

The impact of ESG-related financial risks on the existing risk categories is systematically analysed at Raiffeisen. In the case of climate-related financial risks, scenarios are additionally calculated. Risk indicators are used for monitoring purposes. The results of the analyses and scenario calculations, together with the risk indicators, are reported to the Board of Directors each year.


## Disclosure of climate-related financial risks

Raiffeisen publishes detailed information on the disclosure of climate-related financial risks in the separate notes to the Annual Report entitled "Disclosure of climate-related information according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)", which can be viewed at ] report.raiffeisen.ch/en/download.


## Regulatory provisions

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) classified the Raiffeisen Group as systemically important for the pur- poses of the Swiss Banking Act in a ruling issued on 16 June 2014. According to a FINMA ruling, the Raiffeisen banks are exempt from complying with the rules regarding capital adequacy, risk diversi- fication and liquidity on an individual basis. The relevant legal provisions must be complied with on a consolidated basis.

The Raiffeisen Group has opted for the following approaches when calculating capital requirements:


### Credit risks

The Raiffeisen Group has been applying the model approach based on internal ratings (Foundation IRB approach, "F-IRB") to calculate its capital requirements for credit risks. In the case of positions for which a model-based approach is not possible, the calculation of the required capital for credit risks continues to be carried out according to the standardised approach (SA-BIS). External issuer/ issue ratings from three FINMA-recognised rating agencies are used for the following client categories: sovereigns and central banks, public-sector entities, banks and securities traders, as well as corporates. Issuer/issue ratings from an export insurance agency are also taken into consideration for central governments; however, rating agency ratings take precedence over ratings issued by the export insurance agency. No changes were made to the rating or export insurance agencies used in the year under review.

Positions for which external ratings are used are found chiefly under the following balance sheet items:

\- amounts due from banks;

\- amounts due from clients;

\- financial investments;

\- positive replacement value.

FINMA gave Raiffeisen permission to use the F-IRB approach with a floor to calculate its capital requirements for credit risks. Essentially, the risk-weighted assets calculated using the IRB model approach must not fall below a specified floor (calculated relative to the standardised approach, or SA-BIS). The IRB floor of 80% as determined by national rules has applied since 30 September 2022.

## Market risks

The capital requirements for market risks are calculated using the standard approach under supervisory law. Within this framework, the duration method is applied for general market risk with regard to interest rate instruments, while the delta-plus approach is applied for capital requirements for options.


## Operational risks

The Raiffeisen Group applies the basic indicator approach to calculate capital requirements for oper- ational risks.


## Methods applied to identify default risks and to establish the required value adjustment


### Mortgage-secured loans

Default risks and the probabilities of default of loan positions are reviewed regularly based on the collateral (see also the section "Value of collateral"). In addition to the value of the collateral, the Bank also constantly reviews debtor creditworthiness by monitoring outstanding payments in the case of interest and repayments. This allows the Bank to identify mortgage-secured loans associated with higher risks. These loans are subsequently reviewed in detail by credit specialists. Raiffeisen Switzerland's Recovery department is involved in certain cases. Additional collateral may be requested or a value adjustment recognised based on the missing collateral (see also the section "Steps involved in determining value adjustments and provisions").


## Loans against securities

The Bank monitors the commitments and value of the pledged securities on a daily basis. If the collateral value of the pledged securities falls below the loan commitment amount, the Bank will consider reducing the limit or request additional collateral. If the shortfall widens or if market con- ditions are unusual, the collateral will be realised and the loan settled. If the realisation proceeds are not sufficient to meet the amount outstanding, value adjustments are recognised accordingly.


## Unsecured loans

Unsecured loans are generally business loans to corporate clients, loans to public-sector entities or unsecured account overdrafts of private clients amounting to a maximum of one month's income. For corporate clients and public-sector entities, the volume of unsecured loans is limited by corre- sponding requirements and limits.

For unsecured operating loans, the Bank asks the client to provide information that can be used to assess the state of the company's finances. This information is requested annually or more frequently if necessary. This information is assessed and any increased risks are identified. If the risks are higher, the Bank will conduct a detailed assessment and work with the client to define appropriate measures. If the loan commitment is determined to be at risk in this phase, a value adjustment will be recognised.


### Steps involved in determining value adjustments and provisions

The steps described under "Mortgage loans", "Loans against securities" and "Unsecured loans" are used to identify the need to recognise a value adjustment and/or provision on impaired positions. Furthermore, assets previously identified as being at risk are reassessed quarterly. The value adjustment is updated if needed.

Value adjustments and provisions for expected losses on unimpaired positions are also recognised in accordance with the FINMA Accounting Ordinance.

<!-- PageNumber="160" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Annual financial statements" -->

Management report

Corporate governance

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

Expected losses are calculated based on the probabilities of default and loss estimates from the internal risk models used. For methods, data and more information, please refer to the Regulatory Disclosure under FINMA Circular 2016/1 (in particular, to the table "CRE: IRB - disclosures related to models"). When determining expected losses under the FINMA Accounting Ordinance, the following differences apply in comparison to the regulatory calculations (IRB approach):

\- No regulatory floors (e.g. on PD or LGD) are used; instead of the one-year probability of default (including conservatism and stress allowances), a residual term approach and hence a lifetime probability of default is taken into consideration. For fixed-term products, the residual term in the individual product agreements is used. For products without a fixed term, a minimum term of one year is used.

\- Not all stress premiums are taken into consideration when determining the lifetime probability of default.

\- For positions not measured with internal risk models, provisioning is determined by means of expert estimates.

The Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland has set the parameters for using value adjustments and provisions for expected losses without immediately replenishing them in the event of a crisis. Any use of existing value adjustments and provisions for expected losses is reviewed and submitted to the relevant bodies for approval if new individual value adjustments for impaired positions recog- nised in a reporting period exceed half of the balance of value adjustments and provisions for expected losses as at 31 December of the previous year. Impairments and provisions for expected losses used should be replenished as soon as possible and no more than five years after the end of the crisis.

In the period under review, no value adjustments or provisions for expected losses were applied without replenishing them immediately. Value adjustments and provisions for expected losses are not underfunded.


## Value of collateral

Mortgage-secured loans

An up-to-date valuation of the underlying collateral is available for every mortgage-secured loan. The valuation method varies depending on property type and use.

The Bank values single-family homes, two-family homes, three-family homes, owner-occupied apart- ments, holiday homes and holiday apartments using the real value method and a hedonic pricing model. The hedonic regression model compares the price with similar property transactions based on detailed characteristics of the property in question. The Bank relies on region-specific property price information supplied by an external provider. The bank uses the valuations to update the property value periodically or on an ad hoc basis.

For multi-family units, public/private properties, commercial/industrial real estate and special-purpose real estate, the value of the property is calculated based on the income capitalisation method, which is based on long-term rental income. This model also takes into account market data, location information and vacancy rates. Rental income is reviewed periodically and on an ad hoc basis when there are indications of significant changes in the level of rental income or vacancies. The Bank updates valuations periodically or as required by events.

For agricultural properties, the maximum loan-to-value ratio under the Swiss Rural Land Rights Act applies.

Management report

<!-- FigureContent="Raiffeisen Group Annual Report 2023" -->

</figure>


In addition, Raiffeisen Switzerland's appraisal unit or external accredited assessors must be involved if a property's collateral value exceeds a certain amount or if a property has specific risk features. The liquidation value is also calculated in the event of impaired loans/receivables.

When financing property purchases or financing real estate following a change of ownership, the lower of cost or market value principle generally applies. The lower of lending basis or purchase price is taken as the lending basis. This principle applies to all types of property for at least 24 months from the change of ownership. It does not apply for increases in loans where the amount of the increase to invest in adding to the value of the collateral property is taken into account. Derogation from the lower of cost or market value principle is possible in instances where ownership changes hands at preferential prices between economically and/or legally related individuals or legal entities.


### Loans against securities

The Bank primarily accepts transferable, liquid and actively traded financial instruments (such as bonds and equities) as collateral for Lombard loans and other loans against securities. The Bank also accepts transferable structured products for which there is regular share price information and a market maker.

The Bank discounts market values to account for the market risk associated with marketable securities and to determine the collateral value. The settlement period for structured products and long-tenor products may be considerably longer, and so they are discounted more heavily than liquid instruments. Discounts on life insurance policies or guarantees are dictated by the product.


## Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting


### Business policy on the use of derivative financial instruments

Derivative financial instruments are used for trading and hedging purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are only traded by specially authenticated traders. Raiffeisen trades standardised and OTC instruments for its own and clients' accounts, particularly interest and currency instruments, equity/index securities and commodities.

Hedges in the banking book are created by means of internal deposits and loans with the trading book; the Treasury and Structured Products & FX Advisory units do not take out hedges directly on the market. Hedges in the trading book are largely executed through offsetting trades with external counterparties.

The Raiffeisen banks trade or hedge derivative financial instruments as a commission agent solely to meet clients' needs.


## Use of hedge accounting

The Raiffeisen banks do not use hedge accounting in the meaning of the financial reporting regulations.

<!-- PageNumber="162" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Key figures" -->


## Types of hedged items and hedging instruments

Raiffeisen Switzerland uses hedge accounting predominantly for the following types of transactions:

| Underlying transaction | Hedged using |
| - | - |
| Risks associated with fluctuating interest rates from interest rate sensitive receivables and liabilities in the banking book | Interest rate and currency swaps |
| Price risk of foreign currency positions | Currency future contracts |


## Composition of the groups of financial instruments

Interest-rate-sensitive positions in the banking book are grouped into various time bands by currency and hedged accordingly using macro hedges. Macro hedges are risk-minimising hedging transactions across the entire portfolio. The Bank also uses micro hedges.

Economic connection between hedged items and hedging instruments

At the time a financial instrument is classified as a hedging item, Raiffeisen Switzerland documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The documentation covers things such as the risk management goals and strategy for the hedging instrument and the methods used to assess the effectiveness of the hedge. Effectiveness testing constantly and prospectively assesses the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument by actions such as measuring offsetting changes in the value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument and determining the correlation between these changes.


## Effectiveness testing

A hedge is deemed to be highly effective if the following criteria are essentially met:

\- The hedge is determined to be highly effective both at inception and on an ongoing basis (micro hedges).

\- There is a close economic connection between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.

\- The changes in the value of the hedged item offset changes in the value of the hedging instrument with respect to the hedged risk.


## Ineffectiveness

When entered into, hedging transactions are effective over the entire term. If a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria over time, it is treated as a trading portfolio asset and any gain or loss from the ineffective part is recognised in the income statement.


## Consolidation, accounting and valuation principles


### General principles

Accounting, valuation and reporting conform to the requirements of the Swiss Code of Obligations, the Swiss Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks (plus the related ordinance) and the FINMA Accounting Ordinance (FINMA AO) as well as FINMA Circular 2020/1 "Accounting - banks". The detailed positions shown for a balance sheet item are valued individually. The consolidated annual financial statements represent a true and fair view of the Raiffeisen Group's assets, finances and earnings.

<!-- FigureContent="Raiffeisen Group Annual Report 2023" -->

</figure>



### Consolidation principles

General The consolidation of the banking institutions that make up the Raiffeisen Group, Raiffeisen Switzerland and the Group companies associated with it differs fundamentally from conventional consolidation based on a holding company structure. The individual Raiffeisen banks, as owners of Raiffeisen Switzerland, function as parent companies. Raiffeisen Switzerland is legally a subsidiary even though it acts as the central coordinator, liquidity pool and safety net. The management and regulatory powers of Raiffeisen Switzerland are governed by its Articles of Association and the regulations based on the latter. Consolidation is not based on Raiffeisen Switzerland as a parent company, but represents an aggregation of the annual financial statements of the Raiffeisen banks and the participations held in the Raiffeisen Group. The equity capital in the consolidated annual financial statements is thus the total of the cooperative capital of the individual Raiffeisen banks.


#### Scope of consolidation and consolidation method

The consolidated accounts of the Raiffeisen Group comprise the annual financial statements of the individual Raiffeisen banks, Raiffeisen Switzerland and major Group companies in which the Group directly or indirectly holds more than 50% of the voting shares. Consolidation may be waived for Group companies that are immaterial for the purposes of financial reporting and the risk situation. We refer in this respect to the section entitled "Non-consolidated participations". The fully consoli- dated Group companies and the shareholdings valued according to the equity method are listed in note 7 "Companies in which the Bank holds a permanent direct or indirect significant participation".

Under the full consolidation method, the assets and liabilities, off-balance-sheet transactions, and income and expenses are all recorded in full. Consolidation is carried out using the purchase method. All material amounts receivable and payable, off-balance-sheet transactions, and income and expenses between consolidated companies are offset. Any material intercompany profits that are generated are eliminated in the consolidation.

Minority participations of 20-50% are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method, less any operationally required value adjustments. Participations of less than 20%, those with little materiality in terms of capital or income, and those of a non-strategic nature are not consolidated but are instead accounted for at acquisition cost less any operationally required value adjustments.


##### Consolidation cut-off date

The closing date for the annual financial statements of all consolidated companies is 31 December.


###### Accounting and valuation principles


####### Recording of business events

All business transactions that have been concluded by the balance sheet cut-off date are recorded on a same-day basis in the balance sheet and the income statement in accordance with the relevant valuation principles. Spot transactions that have been concluded but not yet settled are posted to the balance sheet on the trade date.


####### Foreign currencies

Assets and liabilities, as well as cash positions in foreign currencies, are converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet cut-off date. Exchange rate gains and losses arising from this valuation are reported under the item "Result from trading activities and the fair value option". Foreign currency transactions during the year are converted at the rate prevailing at the time the transaction was carried out.

<!-- PageNumber="164" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

If the annual financial statements of Group companies abroad are denominated in foreign currencies, the balance sheet and off-balance sheet are converted at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet cutoff date, while the income statement is converted at the average rate for the year. The conversion difference is recognised directly in equity capital as a currency translation difference with no impact on profit and loss.

| Foreign currency conversion rates |||
| | 31.12.2022 | 31.12.2023 |
| - | - | - |
| EUR | 0.988 | 0.931 |
| USD | 0.925 | 0.842 |

Liquid assets and borrowed funds

These are reported at nominal value. Precious metal liabilities on metal accounts are valued at fair value if the relevant metal is traded on a price-efficient and liquid market.

Discounts and premiums on the Group's own bond issues and central mortgage institution loans are accrued over the period to maturity.

Amounts due from banks and clients, mortgage loans and value adjustment These are reported at nominal value less any value adjustment required. Precious metal assets on metal accounts are valued at fair value if the relevant metal is traded on a price-efficient and liquid market. Interest income is reported on an accruals basis.

Receivables are deemed to be impaired where the Bank believes it improbable that the borrower will be able to completely fulfil their contractual obligations. Impaired loans - and any collateral that may exist - are valued on the basis of the liquidation value.

All leased objects are reported in the balance sheet as "Amounts due from clients" in line with the present-value method.

Individual value adjustments for impaired loans Impaired loans are subject to provisions based on regular analyses of individual loan commitments, while taking into account the creditworthiness of the borrower, the counterparty risk and the esti- mated net realisable sale value of the collateral. If recovery of the amount receivable depends solely on the collateral being realised, full provision is made for the unsecured portion.

If a loan is impaired, it may be possible to maintain an available credit limit as part of a continuation strategy. If necessary, provisions for off-balance-sheet transactions are recognised for these kinds of unused credit limits. For current account overdrafts, which typically show high, frequent volatility over time, initial and subsequent provisions are recognised for the total amount (i.e. individual value adjustments for effective drawdowns and provisions for available limits) under "Changes in value adjustments for default risks and losses from interest operations". If drawdowns change, a corre- sponding amount is transferred between individual value adjustments and provisions in equity. Rever- sals of individual value adjustments or provisions are also recognised under "Changes in value adjust- ments for default risks and losses from interest operations".

Interest and related commissions that have been due for more than 90 days but have not been paid are deemed to be non-performing. In the case of current account overdrafts, interest and commissions are deemed to be non-performing if the specified overdraft limit has been exceeded for more than 90 days. Non-performing and impaired interest (including accrued interest) and commissions are no longer recognised as income but reported directly under value adjustments for default risks.

A receivable is written off at the latest when completion of the realisation process has been confirmed by legal title.

However, impaired loans are written back up in full, i.e. the value adjustment is reversed, if payments of outstanding principal and interest are resumed on schedule in accordance with contractual pro- visions and additional creditworthiness criteria are fulfilled.

Individual value adjustments for credit items are calculated per item on a prudential basis and deducted from the appropriate receivable.

Value adjustments for expected losses on unimpaired loans Value adjustments for expected losses are recognised using a risk-based method and applying historical default parameters, bearing in mind the residual term (see "Steps involved in determining value adjustments and provisions" on pages 160-161).


###### Receivables and liabilities from securities financing transactions

Securities lending and borrowing

Securities lending and borrowing transactions are reported at the value of the cash collateral received or issued, including accrued interest. Securities which are borrowed or received as collateral are only reported in the balance sheet if the Raiffeisen Group takes control of the rights associated with them. Securities which are loaned or provided as collateral are only removed from the balance sheet if the Raiffeisen Group forfeits the rights associated with them. The market values of the borrowed and loaned out securities are monitored daily to enable any additional collateral to be provided or requested as necessary. Fees received or paid under securities lending and repurchase transactions are booked to commission income or commission expenditure on an accruals basis.


####### Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions

Securities purchased with an agreement to resell (reverse repurchase transactions) and securities sold with an agreement to buy back (repurchase transactions) are regarded as secured financing transac- tions and are recorded at the value of the cash collateral received or provided, including accrued interest.

Securities received and delivered are only recorded in/removed from the balance sheet if control of the rights which these securities include is acquired or transferred. The market values of the securities received or delivered are monitored daily so that any additional collateral can be provided or requested as necessary.

Interest income from reverse repurchase transactions and interest expense from repurchase transac- tions are accrued over the term of the underlying transaction.


######## Trading portfolio assets and trading portfolio liabilities

The trading portfolio assets and trading portfolio liabilities are valued and recognised at fair value. Positions for which there is no representative market are valued according to the lower of cost or market value principle. Both the gains and losses arising from this valuation and the gains and losses realised during the period in question are reported under "Result from trading activities and the fair value option". This also applies to interest and dividend income on trading positions. The funding costs for holding trading positions are charged to trading profits and credited to interest income. Income from firm commitments to securities issues is also reported under trading profits.


### Positive and negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments

Reporting

The replacement values of all contracts concluded on the Bank's own account are recognised in the balance sheet regardless of their income statement treatment. The replacement values of exchange- traded contracts concluded on a commission basis are recognised in the balance sheet only to the extent they are not covered by margin deposits. The replacement values of over-the-counter contracts concluded on a commission basis are always reported.

<!-- PageNumber="166" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Regulatory disclosure Key figures" -->

All hedging transactions of the Treasury and Structured Products & FX Advisory units are executed via the trading book, i.e. the Treasury and Structured Products & FX Advisory units do not participate in the market themselves. Only the replacement values of contracts with external counterparties are reported. The note ] "Derivative financial instruments" shows the replacement values and contract volume with external counterparties under "Hedging instruments", calculated using the replacement values and contract volume of the internal hedging transactions by Treasury and Structured Products & FX Advisory.

In the case of structured products issued by Raiffeisen Switzerland that include a debt security, the derivative is split from the underlying contract and valued separately. The debt securities (underlying contracts) are reported at nominal value under "Bond issues and central mortgage institution loans". Discounts and premiums are reported under the item "Accrued expenses and deferred income" or "Accrued income and prepaid expenses", as the case may be, and realised against the interest income over the remaining life. Issued structured products that do not include a debt security and the derivative portions of the structured products that include a debt security are recognised at fair value under "Positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments" and "Negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments".

The structured products issued by Raiffeisen Switzerland B.V. Amsterdam are valued at fair value. These products are carried at market value under "Liabilities from other financial instruments at fair value".

Treatment in the income statement The derivative financial instruments recorded in the trading book are valued on a fair-value basis.

Derivative financial instruments used to hedge risk associated with fluctuating interest rates as part of managing balance sheet structure are valued in accordance with the accrual method. Interest-re- lated gains and losses arising from the early realisation of contracts are accrued over their remaining lives.

The net income from self-issued structured products and the net income from the commission-based issue of structured products by other issuers is booked under "Commission income from securities trading and investment business".


#### Financial investments

Fixed-income debt instruments and warrant bonds are valued according to the lower of cost or market value principle if there is no intention to hold them to maturity. Debt securities acquired with the intention of holding them to maturity are valued according to the accrual method with the dis- count or premium accrued over the remaining life. Equity securities are valued according to the lower of cost or market value principle. Real estate and equity securities acquired through lending activities and other real estate and equities intended for disposal are reported under "Financial investments" and valued using the lower of cost or market value principle. The lower of cost or market value principle refers to the lower of the acquisition cost or the liquidation value. Precious metals held to cover liabilities from precious metals accounts are carried at market value as at the balance sheet cut-off date. In cases where fair value cannot be determined, they are valued according to the lower of cost or market value principle.

Where reclassifications take place between financial investments and equity interests, the financial instruments reclassified are transferred at book value in accordance with Article 17 FINMA AO.

Value adjustments for expected losses

FINMA AO requires value adjustments for expected losses to be recognised on the item "Financial invest- ments (debt securities held to maturity)". These value adjustments for expected losses are recognised using a risk-based method and applying historical default parameters, bearing in mind the residual term (see "Steps involved in determining value adjustments and provisions" on ] pages 160-161).

##### Non-consolidated participations

Non-consolidated participations include minority holdings of between 20% and 50% as well as the immaterial majority interests (Quichet AG, Sedunimmo SA), which are reported and valued according to the equity method. They are tested for impairment as at each balance sheet cut-off date and if necessary, operationally required value adjustments are carried out.

This balance sheet item also includes holdings of less than 20% and all holdings of an infrastructural nature. These are valued in accordance with the principle of initial value, i.e. initial value less opera- tionally required value adjustments. They are tested for impairment as at each balance sheet cut-off date.


###### Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are reported at their purchase cost plus value-enhancing investments and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, as follows:

| Estimated useful life of tangible fixed assets ||
| | years |
| - | - |
| Real estate | 66 years |
| Alterations and fixtures in rented premises | full rental term, maximum 15 years |
| Furniture and fixtures | 8 years |
| Other tangible fixed assets | 5 years |
| Internally developed or purchased core banking software | 10 years |
| IT systems and remaining software | 3 years |

Immaterial investments are booked directly to operating expenses. Large-scale, value-enhancing renovations are capitalised, while repairs and maintenance are recorded as expenses. Expenditure incurred in connection with the continued development of the new core banking systems is recognised as an asset through "Other ordinary income". Properties, buildings under construction and core banking systems are not depreciated until they come into use. Undeveloped building land is not depreciated.

The value of tangible fixed assets is reviewed as at every balance sheet cut-off date whenever events or circumstances give reason to suspect that the book value is impaired. Any impairment is recognised in profit or loss under "Value adjustments on participations and depreciation and amortisation of tangible fixed assets and intangible assets". If the useful life of a tangible fixed asset changes as a result of the review, the residual book value is depreciated over the new duration.


#### Intangible assets

Goodwill: If the cost of acquiring a company is higher than the value of the net assets acquired based on standard Group accounting guidelines, the difference is reported as goodwill. Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. The amortisation period is usually five years. In justifiable cases, it may be as high as 10 years.

Other intangible assets: Acquired intangible assets are recognised where they provide the Group with a measurable benefit over several years. Intangible assets created by the Group itself are not capitalised. Intangible assets are recognised at acquisition cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life within a maximum of five years.

Impairment testing: The value of intangible fixed assets is reviewed as at every balance sheet cut-off date whenever events or circumstances give reason to suspect that the book value is impaired. Any impairment is recognised in profit or loss under "Value adjustments on participations and depreciation and amortisation of tangible fixed assets and intangible assets". If the useful life of an intangible asset changes as a result of the review, the residual book value is amortised over the new duration.

<!-- PageHeader="Key figures" -->

Provisions

Provisions are recognised on a prudential basis for all risks identified at the balance sheet cut-off date that are based on a past event and will probably result in an obligation. With regard to provisions for available overdraft limits, we refer to the chapter "Amounts due from banks and clients, mortgage loans, value adjustments".


##### Reserves for general banking risks

Reserves may be allocated for general banking risks. These are reserves created as a precautionary measure in accordance with accounting standards to hedge against latent risks in the business activities of the Raiffeisen Group.

Taxes Taxes are calculated and booked on the basis of the profit for the year under review. Deferred tax of 15.9% (previous year: 16.1%) was allocated to untaxed reserves and reported as a provision for deferred taxes.

Contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments, obligations to make payments and addi- tional contributions

These are reported at their nominal value under "Off-balance-sheet transactions". Provisions are created for foreseeable risks.

Provisions for expected losses on contingent liabilities and irrevocable commitments are recognised using a risk-based method and applying historical default parameters, bearing in mind the residual term (see "Steps involved in determining value adjustments and provisions" on ] pages 160-161).


### Changes as against previous year

As at 31 December 2023, the accounting and valuation principles have been clarified to the effect that, if required, operationally required value adjustments are now carried out on minority holdings of between 20% and 50% which are recognised using the equity method. In the year under review, a value adjustment required for operational reasons of CHF 20.2 million was carried out on the valuation determined using the equity method. The clarification had no impact on the previous year's figures.


### Events after the balance sheet cut-off date

No events with a measurable effect on the operating result occurred after the balance sheet date.

No netting contracts are used to report the replacement values.

Quality of counterparties

Banks and securities firms: the derivative transactions were conducted primarily with counterparties with a very good credit rating. 91.6% of the positive replacement values are with counterparties with an "upper-medium grade" rating or better (Moody's or a comparable rating).

Clients: in transactions with clients, the required margins were secured by assets or free credit lines.

1 The level of equity capital and voting shares is always stated from the perspective of the directly controlling company.

2 The Raiffeisen banks directly own Raiffeisen Switzerland Cooperative and 21.3% of Pfandbriefbank schweizerischer Hypothekarinstitute AG.

3 Raiffeisen Unternehmerzentrum AG was integrated into Raiffeisen Switzerland in the year under review and the relevant participation was derecognised.

4 Controlled by KMU Capital Holding AG. In 2018, Raiffeisen Switzerland Cooperative initially terminated the shareholders' binding agreement in relation to KMU Capital Holding AG (formerly Investnet Holding AG) for good cause and subsequently, where necessary, challenged the agreements in the context of "Investnet". On the basis of the challenge, Raiffeisen Switzerland is claiming all the shares in KMU Capital Holding AG, which is entirely controlled by KMU Capital AG. The dispute is still ongoing. In connection with the challenge of agreements, Raiffeisen Switzerland also wrote off liabilities of CHF 30 million and contingent liabilities amounting to CHF 30 million in 2018. Raiffeisen Switzerland assumes that there will be no more payments. If, contrary to the expectations of Raiffeisen Switzerland, neither the challenge to the agreements, nor the validity of the termination are confirmed, minority shareholders might be entitled to tender shares in KMU Capital Holding AG to Raiffeisen Switzerland according to the shareholders' binding agreement of 2015 and based on a contractually agreed valuation method (put option). Similarly, the above-mentioned written-off liabilities and contingent liabilities could become relevant again. Due to the aforementioned challenges to agreements and the termination of the shareholders' binding agreement, the put option will not be valued as of 31 December 2023.

6 In 2015, Raiffeisen Switzerland Cooperative sold a call option to a Leonteq founding partner for 2.4% of the share capital in Leonteq AG. The strike price is CHF 210 per share (adjusted for dividend payments) and the term is 10 years (until October 2025).

7 Majority interests that are immaterial for accounting purposes are valued according to the equity method but not listed separately.

8 All participations in cooperation partners and joint ventures by the banks are listed here. Other participations are listed if the shareholding represents more than 10% of the voting share or equity and the shareholding is worth either > CHF 2 million of the equity or the book value is > CHF 15 million.

### 12 - Pension schemes

Most employees of the Raiffeisen Group are covered by the Raiffeisen Pension Fund Cooperative. The statutory retirement age is set at 65. Members have the option of taking early retirement from the age of 58 with a corresponding reduction in benefits. The Raiffeisen Pension Fund Cooperative covers at least the mandatory benefits under Swiss occupational pension law.

The Raiffeisen Employer Foundation manages the individual employer contribution reserves of the Raiffeisen banks and the companies of the Raiffeisen Group. Two Raiffeisen banks and one Group company are insured outside the Raiffeisen Group's pension schemes (other collective foundations, collective insurance contracts, etc.), compared with two in the previous year.

#### 12.2 - Employer contribution reserves

Employer contribution reserves arise for the Raiffeisen Employer Foundation (Raiffeisen) and for pension schemes outside the Raiffeisen Group (Others). These are solely employer-funded pension schemes.

1 Interest paid on the employer contribution reserves is recorded as interest income.

The employer contribution reserves correspond to the nominal value as calculated by the pension scheme. The individual employer contribution reserves of the affiliated companies cannot be offset against each other. The balance of the employer contribution reserves is recorded in the balance sheet under "Other assets". The employer contribution reserves are subject neither to waiver of use (conditional or unconditional), nor to other necessary value adjustments. Any discounting effect is not considered.

##### 12.3 - Economic benefit/obligation and retirement benefit expenditure

According to the audited annual financial statements for the year under review and the previous year (in accordance with Swiss GAAP FER 26) of the Raiffeisen Pension Fund Cooperative, the coverage ratio is:

||||
| - | - | - |
| Raiffeisen Pension Fund Cooperative |||
| per cent | 31.12.2022 | 31.12.2023 |
| Coverage ratio | 107.1 | 111.6 |

The target level of the value fluctuation reserve of the Raiffeisen Pension Fund Cooperative was 117% as at 31 December 2023. As at the end of 2023, the coverage ratio was below this target level and therefore there were no uncommitted funds. The Assembly of Delegates of Raiffeisen Pension Fund Cooperative decides how any uncommitted funds will be used. In general, the "principles for the use of uncommitted funds (profit participation)" which it issues are applied. The Board of Directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland assumes that even if uncommitted funds are available, no economic benefits will accrue to the employer until further notice; uncommitted funds are to be used to benefit pension scheme members.

The affiliated employers have no economic benefits or economic obligations for which allowance would have to be made in the balance sheet and income statement.

2 Subordinated perpetual Additional-Tier-1 bond with contingent write-down. With FINMA's consent, the bond can be terminated on a unilateral basis by Raiffeisen Switzerland (no earlier than five years following issue).

3 The higher interest rate is attributable to the fact that the bond was issued in EUR.

4 In the case of issued structured products that include a debt security, the derivative is split from the underlying contract and valued and presented separately. Underlying instruments are recog- nised at their nominal value in "Bond issues and central mortgage institution loans". The derivative components of the products are recognised at market value in "Positive replacement values of derivative financial instruments" or "Negative replacement values of derivative financial instruments".

5 Average weighted interest rate (volume-weighted).

As product rollovers during the year and rating changes during the year can have a material impact on releases and new allocations if shown gross, the decision was made to report them net.

2 The provisions of CHF 33 million for other business risks include provisions of CHF 20 million, which resulted from the repurchase of the now-liquidated ARIZON Sourcing Ltd.

3 Other provisions include provisions for legal expenses.

The category "Liabilities arising from client deposits" also includes customer deposits that are not of an investment nature. Funds in trust and custody-only client relationships are not included. Custody-only client relationships are considered to be banks and institutional clients for which Raiffeisen serves solely as a custodian bank.

## Report of the statutory auditor


### Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements
 :selected:
Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Raiffeisen Group (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2023, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements (pages 148 to 193) give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2023 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Swiss accounting principles for banks and comply with Swiss law.

<figure>

![](figures/151)

</figure>


Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA- CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

#### Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For the matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements" section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to

address the matter below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Recoverability of customer loans and measurement of value adjustments and provisions for default risks

Audit Matter Raiffeisen Group recognizes customer loans, consisting of amounts due from clients and mortgage loans, at nominal value less any value adjustments required.

The identification of a value adjustment or provision on impaired items is carried out on an individual basis and is calculated on the basis of the difference between the carrying amount of the receivable or any higher limit and the expected amount to be collected, taking into account counterparty risk and the net proceeds from the realization of any collateral.

In accordance with the accounting requirements for banks (FINMA Accounting Ordinance and FINMA-Circ. 2020/1 "Accounting - Banks"), Raiffeisen Group also recognizes value adjustments and provisions for expected losses on non-impaired items.

When calculating value adjustments and provisions for default risks, estimates must be made which involve significant judgments and may vary depending on the assessment.

Raiffeisen Group reports amounts due from clients of CHF 11.6 billion and mortgage loans of CHF 211.0 billion. In this context, as of the balance sheet date, there were value adjustments and provisions for impaired credit items of CHF 315.3 million and value adjustments and provisions for expected losses on non-impaired credit items of CHF 493.9 million. Since customer loans represent with 74.9% a major part of the assets in Raiffeisen Group's consolidated financial statements, we consider the recoverability of customer loans and the calculation of value adjustments and provisions for default risks as a key audit matter.

Raiffeisen Group describes its accounting and valuation principles for customer loans and value adjustments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages 165 and 166. Further explanations on the identification of default risks, the calculation of the valuation adjustments and the valuation of the collaterals can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on the pages 160 to 162.

Our audit response

Our audits included assessing the design and effectiveness of the processes and controls associated with credit granting and monitoring, as well as identifying and measuring valuation adjustments and provisions on impaired and non-impaired credit items. In addition, we assessed the concept applied by Raiffeisen Group for the recognition of value adjustments and provisions for expected losses on non-impaired items pursuant to Art. 25 FINMA Accounting Ordinance in the consolidated financial statements.

In addition, we tested the recoverability of credit exposures on a sample basis and assessed the methods and assumptions used in the calculation of individual value adjustments and provisions for default risks. Our sample included both randomly and risk-oriented selected credit items. The risk-oriented sample particularly included unsecured loans to commercial customers and financing of investment properties.

Further audit procedures included the assessment of compliance with and implementation of the accounting and valuation principles of Raiffeisen Group as well as the appropriateness of the explanations for the identification of default risks, for the determination of the value adjustments and for the valuation of the collateral in the consolidated financial statements.

Our audit procedures did not result in any objections regarding the recoverability of customer loans as well as the measurement of the valuation adjustments and provisions for default risks.


#### Other information

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the information related to sustainability and our auditor reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Board of Directors' responsibilities for the consolidated financial statements The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which give a true and fair view in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework for banks and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located on EXPERTsuisse's website at: https://www.expertsuisse.ch/en/audit- report. This description forms an integral part of our report.


## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

<figure>

![](figures/157)

</figure>


In accordance with Art. 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.

We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

The Raiffeisen Group, in its capacity as the central orga- nisation, is obligated to comply with capital adequacy rules and is thus subject to disclosure requirements under supervisory law. Information is published in line with the regulations laid down in the Capital Adequacy Ordinance (CAO) and FINMA Circular 2016/1 "Disclosure - banks".

As Raiffeisen is classified as systemically important, it has to meet higher capital requirements. It is subject to capital requirements for a going concern and require- ments for additional loss-absorbing capital in the event of a crisis (gone concern).

The high degree of earnings retention in the cooperative model means that the Group is able to strengthen its core capital on an ongoing basis, is exceptionally well capitalised and that the requirements are met in full without applying transitional provisions.

Regulatory disclosure
===

The Raiffeisen Group is obligated to comply with capital adequacy rules and is thus required by supervisory law to make risk, capital adequacy and liquidity disclosures.

The regulatory disclosure is based on FINMA Circular 2016/1 "Disclosure - banks". It includes qualitative and quantitative information on risk, capital adequacy and liquidity, and is published in the separate publication "Regulatory disclosure", which is available on the Raiffeisen website ] raiffeisen.ch/ aufsichtsrechtliche-offenlegung.

On 16 June 2014, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) issued an order classifying the Raiffeisen Group as systemically important. The provisions covering systemic importance require an additional capital adequacy disclosure. The corresponding information on risk-based capital requirements and unweighted capital requirements (leverage ratio) is available in £ note 3 in the full regulatory disclosure.

The following page of this Annual Report includes an overview of the key figures from the compre- hensive regulatory disclosure. The full disclosure is published on the website £ raiffeisen.ch/ aufsichtsrechtliche-offenlegung.
